Furthermore, the amount of space available in the filesystem cannot be allocated all to a single file due to fragmentation.   <P>If the filesystem is fragmented, use lmadm to defragment the filesystem. However, if there is no fragmentation (fragment reports 0%), then the available space in its entirety can be allocated to a single file.<P>If nvram is not mounted, no data are reported. <P><H3>Options </H3><DL><DT>-k<DD>All output data is rounded to 1024 bytes. </DL><H3>Implementation</H3>Command implemented in V21.<P><H3>Associated Files </H3>$c/lmdf    <P><H3>See Also</H3><A HREF="Cdbge.html#XREF40448"><CODE>lmadm</A></CODE><P>
