As applications grow, this results in oversized application files that, when launched, require more time and more memory on the 3DO Station than necessary. To avoid that, you would need a link option that separates symbols from actual code, generating two files instead of one. Since this option is not currently available, the Debugger provides a <CODE>stripaif</CODE> tool that gives similar results.<P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>None</DL><H3>Return Value</H3><DL><DT>None</DL><H3>Caveats</H3>None.<P>
