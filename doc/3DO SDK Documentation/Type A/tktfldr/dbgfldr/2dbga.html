<TITLE>3DO Debugger menus</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF17636">3DO Debugger menus</LINK></H1><HR>This section discusses all 3DO Debugger menu commands. <P><H3>Keyboard shortcuts</H3>Keyboard shortcuts are listed with each command and also summarized on the Quick Reference card that is part of your documentation package. <P><H2>The File menu</H2>The File menu controls how the 3DO Debugger tool operates as an application on the Macintosh. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Filemenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>File menu. </I><P><H3>New </H3>Does nothing and is always disabled.<P><H3>Close</H3>Closes the active window. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-W<P><H3>Save...</H3>Produces an ASCII text file of the active Data window. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-S<P><H3>Directories...</H3>Displays the Directories submenu, which offers the commands listed in the following table: <P><PRE><B>Table 1: </B><I> Subcommands of the Directories command.</I>--------------------------------------------------------Command       |Description                              --------------------------------------------------------Current       |Displays the current Source Directory    Source...     |pathway. To modify the current source                  |directory, use Directories &gt; Setup.      --------------------------------------------------------Current       |Displays the current Data Directory      Data...       |pathway. To modify the current data                    |directory, use Directories &gt; Setup.      --------------------------------------------------------Setup...      |Presents a standard Macintosh directory                |selection dialog, which allows you to                  |select the directory where source and                  |data files are found. Set the source                   |directory to the folder location of the                |source file, the data directory to the                 |location of the .sym file.               --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><B>Note: </B>You can also set source directories using a .spt script file. See  <A HREF="./1dbgb.html#XREF26436">Using an spt script file to set source directories</A> for more information.<P><H3>Save Config</H3>Saves the current window positions and settings as part of the preferences file.<P><H3>Save Config As...</H3>Saves the current window positions and settings as a separate file. <P><H3>Load Config...</H3>Opens a file previously created with the Save Config As command. The file specifies window positions and settings. <P><H3>Start CD Access Log...</H3>Causes the Debugger to start collecting information about CD-ROM access in a log file. You are prompted for the location of the file. CD access is performed by a number of functions in the filesystem folio. If you are working with a version of the system that does not have a CD-ROM attached, CD-ROM access is simulated. You can use this command to determine how much of a program's time is spent retrieving data from the CD-ROM.<P><H3>Page Setup...</H3>Displays the standard Macintosh Page Setup dialog for changing page size, orientation, and other defaults for printing 3DO Debugger windows.<P><H3>Print...</H3>Prints the active window.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-P<P><H3>Special Mode</H3>When you select this mode, the Debugger no longer goes through the main event loop and gives high priority to file I/O. As a result, your program runs much faster than in normal mode. When you select Special Mode, a dialog informs you that you can click the mouse button or press any key to return to normal mode. <P><H3>Loop On...</H3>Allows looping on a script, useful when preparing a standalone demonstration program. If you select Loop On, you are prompted for a file, which has to be a shell script or a 3DO application. The file is executed in the foreground repeatedly until you click the mouse button or press a key. At that time, the current cycle is executed to completion but no new cycle is started. <P><H3>No Target Check</H3>Select this item to temporarily disconnect the Macintosh from the 3DO Station. The Macintosh will ignore any incoming message or I/O request from the 3DO Station. To resume normal communication, uncheck the item. You shouldn't have to use this feature during a normal debugging session. <P><H3>Acquire</H3>This command is always disabled. <P><H3>Release &amp; Quit</H3>Releases the 3DO Station by executing a Go command, then quits the application. For more information on the Go command, see <A HREF="#XREF34460">The Execution menu</A>.<P><H3>Quit</H3>Quits the application and returns to the Finder.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-Q<P><A NAME="XREF28625"><H2>The Edit menu</A></H2>The Edit menu lets you edit text, clear the active Variables window, and display the Preferences dialog boxes.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Editmenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 2: </B><I>Edit menu.</I><P><H3>Undo</H3>Reverts your last editing operation to the original value.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-Z<P><H3>Cut</H3>Deletes selected text and puts it on the Clipboard, replacing the previous contents of the Clipboard. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-X<P><H3>Copy</H3>Copies selected text to the Clipboard, replacing the previous contents of the Clipboard.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-C<P><H3>Paste</H3>Inserts a copy of the Clipboard contents at the insertion point or replaces selected text.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-V<P><H3>Clear</H3>Deletes aselected variable <I>if</I> the Variables window is the active window. Otherwise, clears the entire Terminal window.<P><H3>Select All</H3>Selects all text in the Terminal window if it is the active window. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-A<P><H3>Fonts... </H3>Changes fonts in the active Data and Terminal windows. This command is dimmed if it does not affect the active window. <P><H3>Preferences... </H3>Displays a dialog box for selecting preferences and downloading flash ROM. This dialog box is discussed in <A HREF="./2dbgi.html#XREF25825">Preferences and Configuration dialog box</A>.<P><A NAME="XREF36145"><H2>The View menu</A></H2>The View menu opens 3DO Debugger windows or brings them to the front if they are open already. The Debugger displays a list of all Variables windows it creates during one session at the bottom of the menu. You can make a Variables window active by selecting it in that list. You can also send a selected variable from the active Source window to the Variables window that receives data for display.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Viewmenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 3: </B><I>View menu. </I><P><H3>New Window</H3>Opens a new Disassembly, Data, or Source window. <P>If you hold down the Shift key while opening a new display window, the selection in the active window is used as the base address for the new window.<P>Keyboard shortcuts: <P>Command-J (DisAsm)Command-B (Data)Command-K (Source)<P><H3>Variables </H3>Opens a new Variables window. To bring an already open one to the front, select it from the list of open display windows at the bottom of the View menu. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-M<P><H3>Registers </H3>Opens (or brings to the front) the ARM CPU Registers window. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-R<P><H3>Stacks</H3>Opens (or brings to the front) the ARM CPU Stack window.  <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-E<P><H3>Symbols</H3>Opens (or brings to the front) the Symbol window for the current program.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-Y<P><H3>BreakPoints</H3>Opens (or brings to the front) the BreakPoints window.  <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-U<P><H3>Terminal </H3>Opens (or brings to the front) the Terminal window.  <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-T<P><H3>Clock</H3>Opens the Target Clock window, which displays the current ticks of the program running on the 3DO Station in hexadecimal and microseconds. <P><H3>Send Variable Data</H3>Allows you to send a variable selected in the Source window to the Variable window that receives data. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-D<P><H3>(Open Display Windows)</H3>Lists all openVariables windows at their examined addresses. Select one to bring it to the front.<P><A NAME="XREF34460"><H2>The Execution menu</A></H2>The Execution menu controls the execution of the program running on the 3DO Station.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Executionmenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 4: </B><I>Execution menu. </I><P><H3>Go</H3>Starts execution at the current value of the program counter (PC). If you've just launched the Debugger, use this command to release the operating system.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-G<P><H3>Stop</H3>Stops the current task on the 3DO Station but not the operating system. If the current task was not your program but a system task, you may need to try again.<P>If you know the program well, a better way to stop it is to display a Source or Disassembly window and set a breakpoint on an instruction likely to be executed. The program will then stop at the break. <P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-. (Command-Period)<P><H3>HW Reset...</H3>Prompts whether you want to reset the target hardware. If you confirm, resets and relaunches the target when you press Command-G.<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-H<P><H3>Trace</H3>Provides a menu which has a submenu of available trace options:<P><UL><LI>In-Traces into subroutines and functions. Keyboard shortcut: Command-I<LI>Over-Traces across subroutines and functions. Keyboard shortcut: Command-O</UL><H3>Step Over</H3>Executes one instruction at the current value of the program counter (PC), stepping over subroutines and function calls. If a Source window is active (with the Examine field set to PC), one source line will be executed; otherwise, one opcode will be executed. (See Note below.)<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-, (Command-Comma)<P><H3>Step In</H3>Executes one instruction at the current value of the program counter (PC), stepping into subroutines and function calls but stepping over system calls. By default, one opcode is executed. If a Source window is active, one source line is executed. (See Note below.)<P>Keyboard shortcut: Command-; (Command-Semicolon)<P><B>Note: </B>Sometimes, the 3DO Debugger does not step and requests that a Source window be set to PC. If that happens, create a new Source window (Command-K) and try again. If you always keep one Source window set to PC, this condition will never occur. <P><H3>Kill Aborted Task</H3>If a task causes an abort, the Debugger takes control. You then have two choices: Make an appropriate change, for example, change a variable, and then continue execution, or kill the task that caused the abort using the Kill Aborted Task command. This allows you to execute a new task without performing a Hardware Reset.<P><H3>Execute</H3>Prompts you for a program to execute. Using this command is similar to typing the program's name into the Terminal window, but sets up directories appropriately in addition to executing the program. <P><A NAME="XREF15988"><H2>The Target menu</A></H2>The Target menu controls launching, downloading, and dumping the program running on the 3DO Station and to access the performance analyzer. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Targetmenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 5: </B><I>Target menu. </I><P><H3>Launch... </H3>Displays a dialog box for selecting a script to execute. <P><UL><LI>Execute Current (or pressing Return) selects the named script. <LI>Execute lets you specify a new script.<LI>Cancel (or pressing the Escape or Command key) lets you use the Debugger without a script. This allows you to examine memory, but not much else. </UL>Keyboard shortcut: Command-L<P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Launchprompt.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 6: </B><I>Launch dialog box.</I><P><H3>Download... </H3>Presents a standard Macintosh file selection dialog box for downloading binary files to the 3DO Station.<P><H3>Memory Dump... </H3>Displays a dialog box that lets you dump target RAM as a binary image file. Enter the start and end addresses, then select Dump to create the output binary file.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/MemoryDump.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 7: </B><I>Memory Dump dialog box. </I><P><H3>Performance Analyzer... </H3>Displays the Performance Analyzer dialog box, which lets you monitor the percentage of execution time spent in different routines.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/PerfAnalyzer.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 8: </B><I>Performance analyzer dialog box. </I><P>Click Start Sampling to begin collecting samples; click Stop Sampling to pause the sampling process. Click Stop &amp; Quit to stop the sampling process. Output goes to a text file called <I>3DODebug.Perf</I>. The performance analyzer reports:<P><UL><LI>how much time is spent in execution of the user task and how much time is spent on system tasks and other overhead<p><LI>how much time is spent in the different functions in the user task </UL>You can get both hierarchical and nonhierarchical samples in the report. A hierarchical sample provides all calling functions for each function that is called. <P><B>Note: </B>Since the performance analyzer itself affects the performance of the system, you only get a rough estimate of the actual performance when you use it. <P><H3>Redirect Terminal</H3>Writes a copy of all terminal output to a file you specify. <P><P>
