<TITLE>The Variables window</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF27985">The Variables window</LINK></H1><HR>The Variables window displays user-selected variables and current values. <P>A Variables window is most useful for examining variables or data structures or for dereferencing pointers. It is also capable of parsing C-style expressions. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Var1.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Variables window. </I><P><H2>Using multiple Variables windows</H2>You can open Variables windows as needed. Each window has a number as part of the window name. At any given time, only one Variables window receives data. You can select that window by choosing Receive Data in its Options menu. The system automatically turns off all other Variables windows. <P>When you send a variable from another window to the Variables window, the window receiving data comes to the front. <P><B>Note: </B>If there is only one Variables window, it is always the window that receives variable data.<P><H2>Working with Variables windows</H2>In <A HREF="dbg1frst.html#XREF37307">3DO Debugger Quick Start</A> you are stepped through a small example of using the Variables window. The following table describes all major operations you can perform in the Variables window.<P><PRE><B>Table 1: </B><I>  Working with the Variables window.</I>--------------------------------------------------------To...          |Do this...                              --------------------------------------------------------Open a window  |Press Command-M or select Variables from               |the View menu.                          --------------------------------------------------------Add a variable |* Enter the variable you want to displayor other       |into the text edit field at the top of  expression to  |the window. Any standard C expression isthe display    |allowed.                                               |* Press Return or click the Evaluate                   |button.                                                |This enters the selection into the                     |window and displays the current value.  --------------------------------------------------------Examine a      |Select a variable in any window by      variable from  |double-clicking on it, then press       any window     |Command-Shift-M to examine that variable               |in the Variables window.                --------------------------------------------------------Delete a       |* Click on the variable you want to     variable       |delete.The variable name is displayed in               |the text field at the top of the window                |and the Clear button is enabled.                       |* Click on the Clear button or press the               |Clear key on the Macintosh keyboard (you               |may need to do this twice if the                       |variable is not editable).              --------------------------------------------------------Change variable|* Click on the variable.The variable    values         |name is displayed in the text field at  interactively  |the top of the window. When you select                 |the variable, its current value is                     |displayed in the Value field.                          |* Type the new value into the Value                    |field and press Return or Enter to                     |change the value.                                      |Note: You cannot edit constant values,                 |expressions, or the base of a C                        |structure. In that case, Not Editable is               |displayed in the Current Value field.   --------------------------------------------------------Dereference a  |Commanddouble-click on the pointer. A   pointer        |new line representing the dereferenced                 |pointer is added to the variables list.                |If the field cannot be dereferenced, you               |hear an alert sound.                    --------------------------------------------------------Select a window|Choose Receive Data from the Options    for receiving  |menu of the desired Variables window. Todata           |compare the values of variables at                     |different states in the program, you can               |create several Variables windows and                   |select a different one for receiving                   |data at any state that's of importance. --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><H2>Variables window options</H2>The Variables window Options menu lets you determine how data is displayed in the Variables window. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/VarOptions.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 2: </B><I>Variables window Options menu.</I><P><H3>Auto Update</H3>Automatically refreshes the window during stepping operations or when the program executing on the target hits a breakpoint. This slows the general operation of the Debugger, but provides a more current and accurate display.<P><H3>Receive Data</H3>If you choose Send Variable Data to work with an expression, the Debugger directs it to the Variables window for which Receive Data is selected. Selecting Receive Data in a window deselects it in any other window. <P><H3>Decimal / Hex / char / C string / Pascal string</H3>Allows you to select the format of the displayed variable. If the field cannot be displayed in the selected format, nothing happens. If a C string is longer than 256 characters, it is truncated to about 250 characters. <P><H3>Frac16-16 / UFrac16-16 / Frac12-20 / UFrac12-20 </H3>Select one of these options to display fixed point numbers or their unsigned counterparts. The number is displayed as <CODE>int.frac</CODE>. For example, Frac16 x = 0x00018000 is displayed as 1.5. <P>You can also enter a new value using this format. No conversion is performed if you use no decimal point. For example, if you type 1.0, the new value is 0x00010000, but if you type 1, the new value is 0x00000001.Frac16 numbers-which use the Frac16 type defined by the operating system-are automatically displayed in Frac16-16 format. <P><P>
