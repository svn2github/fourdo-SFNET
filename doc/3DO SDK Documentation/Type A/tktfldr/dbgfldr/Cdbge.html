It checks and repairs (-c), defragments (-d), mounts (-m),unmounts (-u), and auto-maintains (-a) the filesystem.<P><H3>Options</H3><DL><DT>-a<DD>Auto-maintains the filesystem: Unmounts the filesystem, checks/repairs, defragments, and remounts the filesystem. In case of a failure in the consistency check/repair or defragmentation process, the filesystem is formatted. This option is used mainly at system startup. This option is mutually exclusive with all other options except for -v and -y. This option implies -y.</DL><DL><DT>-c<DD> Consistency check and repair. Consistency check is performed in multiple passes and all repairs are reported. This option is mutually exclusive with -a, -m, and -u.</DL><DL><DT> -d<DD>Defragments the filesystem. As a result of adding and deleting files, filesystems become fragmented and free extents become scattered. The defragmentation process gathers all scattered free extents and combines them into a single contiguous extent. This process not only improves system performance, but it also enables the filesystem to succeed in allocating storage for larger files. This option is mutually exclusive with -a, -m, and -u.</DL><DL><DT>-m<DD>Mounts the filesystem. It only mounts the filesystem on the specified device, if the filesystem is not already mounted. This option is mutually exclusive with all other options except -v and -y.</DL><DL><DT>-t<DD>Displays output on the TV monitor as well.</DL><DL><DT>-u<DD>Unmounts the filesystem. It only unmounts the filesystem, if the filesystem is mounted. This option is mutually exclusive with all other options except -v and -y. </DL><DL><DT>-v<DD>Signifies verbose.</DL><DL><DT>-y<DD>Performs all major/minor repairs needed to bring the filesystem to a consistent state.</DL><DL><DT>-z<DD>Removes all zero-sized files. This is performed during the defragmentation process, therefore it is to be used in conjunction with the -a or -d options. </DL><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>dev_name<DD>Name of the device on which the filesystem resides.</DL><DL><DT>unit<DD>Device unit number.</DL><DL><DT>offset<DD>Offset within the device where the filesystem   resides.</DL><DL><DT>mount_dir<DD>Name of the directory on which the filesystem is mounted. </DL><H3>Examples</H3>The following line maintains the nvram filesystem for operation, this is mainly invoked at system startup:<P><CODE><PRE>$boot/system/Programs/lmadm -a ram 3 0 nvram</CODE></PRE>The following line performs consistency check and an automatic repair:<P><CODE><PRE>$c/lmadm -cy ram 3 0 nvram </CODE></PRE>The following line verbosely performs a defragmentation process on the nvram filesystem:<P><CODE><PRE>$c/lmadm -dv ram 3 0 nvram </CODE></PRE>The following line mounts the nvram filesystem<P><CODE>$c/lmadm -m ram 3 0 nvram</CODE><P><H3>Caveats</H3>Don't run the defragmentation process unless you have a clean filesystem.<P>Always check/repair the filesystem first, before the defragmentation process is started. If you use both -d and -c, the filesystem is first checked and repaired and then defragmented. The result of defragmenting a corrupted filesystem is unpredictable. If you use -a, and the check/repair process fails, the filesystem is automatically formatted. All existing data on the filesystem is cleared. <P><H3>Implementation </H3>Command implemented in V21. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>$c/lmadm<P>
