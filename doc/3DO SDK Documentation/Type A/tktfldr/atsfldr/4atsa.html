<TITLE>The ARM procedure call standard</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF17932">The ARM procedure call standard</LINK></H1><HR>This section defines the ARM Procedure Call Standard. Explanatory text, not itself part of the standard, is bracketed by "(Aside:" and ")".<P>(Aside:<B> </B>This explanation may help you to understand the APCS but is not, itself, part of the APCS. If an explanation appears to conflict with the standard then the standard should be considered definitive and the narrative merely an indication of intent).<P>A program fragment which conforms to the APCS while making a call to an external function (one which is visible between compilation units) is said to be <I>conforming</I>. A program which conforms to the APCS at all instants of execution is said to be <I>strictly conforming</I> or to <I>conform strictly</I>.<P>(Aside: In general, compiled code is expected to be strictly conforming; hand-written code merely conforming).<P>Whether or not, and when program fragments for a particular ARM-based environment are required to conform strictly to the APCS is part of the definition of that environment.<P>In the following sections, clauses following <I>shall</I> and <I>shall not</I> are obligations which must be met in order to conform to the APCS.<P><H2>Register names</H2>The ARM has 15 visible general registers, a program counter register and 8 floating-point registers.<P>(Aside: In non-user machine modes, some general registers are shadowed. In all modes, the availability of the floating-point instruction set depends on the processor model, hardware and operating system).<P><H2>General registers</H2><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------Name        |Number  |APCS Role                         --------------------------------------------------------a1          |0       |argument1 / integer result /                  |        |scratch register                  --------------------------------------------------------a2          |1       |argument 2 / scratch register     --------------------------------------------------------a3          |2       |argument 3/ scratch register      --------------------------------------------------------a4          |3       |argument 4/ scratch register      --------------------------------------------------------            |        |                                  --------------------------------------------------------v1          |4       |register variable                 --------------------------------------------------------v2          |5       |register variable                 --------------------------------------------------------v3          |6       |register variable                 --------------------------------------------------------v4          |7       |register variable                 --------------------------------------------------------v5          |8       |register variable                 --------------------------------------------------------            |        |                                  --------------------------------------------------------sb/v6       |9       |static base / register variable   --------------------------------------------------------sl/v7       |10      |stack limit / stack chunk handle /            |        |reg. variable                     --------------------------------------------------------fp          |11      |frame pointer                     --------------------------------------------------------ip          |12      |scratch register / new-sb in                  |        |inter-link-unit calls             --------------------------------------------------------sp          |13      |lower end of current stack frame  --------------------------------------------------------lr          |14      |link address / scratch register   --------------------------------------------------------pc          |15      |program counter                   --------------------------------------------------------</PRE>(Aside: The 16 integer registers are divided into 3 sets:<P><UL><LI>4 argument registers which can also be used as scratch registers or as caller-saved register variables;<LI>5 callee-saved registers, conventionally used as register variables;<LI>7 registers which have a dedicated role, at least some of the time, in at least one variant of APCS-3 (see <A HREF="./4atsb.html#XREF35590">APCS variants</A>).</UL>The 5 frame registers fp, ip, sp, lr and pc have dedicated roles in all variants of the APCS.<P>The ip register has a dedicated role only during function call; at other times it may be used as a scratch register.<P>(Aside: Conventionally, ip is used by compiler code generators as the/a local code generator temporary register).<P>There are dedicated roles for sb and sl in some variants of the APCS; in other variants they may be used as callee-saved registers.<P>The APCS permits lr to be used as a register variable when not in use during a function call.

See <A HREF="./4atsb.html#XREF35590">APCS variants</A>).<P><UL><LI>sp shall point at or above the current stack chunk limit; if the limit is explicit, it shall point at least 256 bytes above it (see <A HREF="#XREF37800">The stack</A>);<LI>fp shall contain 0 or shall point to the most recently created stack backtrace structure (see <A HREF="#XREF24009">The stack backtrace data structure</A>);<LI>the space between sp and the stack chunk limit shall be readable, writable memory which can be used by the called function as temporary workspace, and overwritten with any values before the function returns (see <A HREF="#XREF37800">The stack</A>);<LI>arguments shall have been marshalled as described below.</UL>If the target function is reentrant (see <A HREF="./4atsb.html#XREF35590">APCS variants</A>) then it has two entry points and control arrives:<P><UL><LI>at the <I>intra-link-unit entry point</I> if the caller has been directly linked with the callee;<LI>at the <I>inter-link-unit entry point</I> if the caller has been separately linked with a <I>stub</I> of the callee.</UL>(Aside: Sometimes the two entry points are at the same address; usually they will be separated by a single instruction).<P>On arrival at the intra-link-unit entry point, sb shall identify the static data of the link unit which contains both the caller and the callee.<P>On arrival at the inter-link-unit entry point, ip shall identify the static data of the link unit containing the target function, or the target function shall make neither direct nor indirect use of static data.<P>(Aside: In practice this usually means the callee must be a leaf function making no direct use of static data).<P>(Aside: The way in which sb <I>identifies</I> the static data of a link unit is not specified by the APCS. See<I> </I> <A HREF="../arrfldr/3arrj.html#XREF31382">ARM shared library format</A> for details of support for reentrant code and shared libraries).<P>(Aside: If the call is by tail continuation, <I>calling function</I> means that which would be returned to, were the tail continuation converted to a return).<P>(Aside: If code is not required to be reentrant or sharable then sb may be used as v6, an additional variable register).<P><A NAME="XREF17958"><H2>Data representation and argument passing</A></H2>Argument passing in the APCS is defined in terms of an ordered list of machine-level values passed from the caller to the callee, and a single word or floating point result passed back from the callee to the caller. Each value in the argument list shall be:<P><UL><LI>a word-sized, integer value;<LI>a floating point value (of size 1, 2 or 3 words).</UL>A callee may corrupt any of its arguments, howsoever passed.<P>(Aside: The APCS does not define the layout in store of records, arrays and so forth, used by ARM-targeted compilers for C, Pascal, Fortran-77, etc.; nor does it prescribe the order in which language-level arguments are mapped into their machine-level representations. In other words, the mapping from language-level data types, and arguments to APCS words is defined by each language implementation, not by the APCS. Indeed, there is no formal reason why two ARM-targeted implementations of the same language should not use different mappings and, hence, not support cross-calling. Obviously, it would be very unhelpful to stand by this formal position so implementors are encouraged to adopt not just the letter of the APCS but also the natural mappings of source language objects into argument words. Guidance about this is given in <A HREF="./4atsc.html#XREF36070">C language calling conventions</A>).<P>At the instant control arrives at the target function, the argument list shall be allocated as follows:<P><UL><LI>in APCS variants which support the passing of floating-point arguments in floating-point registers (see <A HREF="./4atsb.html#XREF35590">APCS variants</A>), the first 4 floating-point arguments (or fewer if the number of floating-point arguments is less than 4) shall be in machine registers f0-f3;<LI>the first 4 remaining argument words (or fewer if there are fewer than 4 argument words remaining in the argument list) shall be in machine registers a1-a4;<LI>the remainder of the argument list (if any) shall be in memory, at the location addressed by sp and higher-addressed words thereafter.</UL>A floating-point value not passed in a floating-point register is treated as 1, 2 or 3 integer values, as appropriate to its precision.<P><H2>Control return</H2>When the return link value for a function call is placed in the pc:<P><UL><LI>sp, fp, sl/v7, sb/v6, v1-v5, and f4-f7 shall contain the same values as they did at the instant of control arrival;<LI>if the function returns a simple value of size one word or less, then that value shall be in a1;</UL>(Aside: a language implementation is not obliged to consider <I>all</I> single-word values simple. See<I> </I><A HREF="./4atsc.html#XREF36070">C language calling conventions</A>).<P><UL><LI>if the function returns a simple floating point value then that value shall<I> </I>be in f0.</UL>(Aside: The values of ip, lr, a2-a4, f1-f3 and any stacked arguments are undefined).<P>(Aside: The definition of control return means that this is a <I>callee saves</I> standard).<P>(Aside: In 32-bit ARM modes, the caller's PSR flags are not preserved across a function call. In 26-bit ARM modes, the caller's PSR flags are naturally reinstated when the return link pointer is placed in pc. Note that the N, Z, C and V flags from lr at the instant of entry must be reinstated; it is not sufficient merely to preserve the PSR across the call. Consider, a function <CODE>ProcA</CODE> which tail continues to <CODE>ProcB</CODE> as follows:<P><CODE><PRE>    CMPS   a1, #0    MOVLT  a2, #255    MOVGE  a2, #0    B      ProcB</CODE></PRE>If <CODE>ProcB</CODE> merely preserves the flags it sees on entry, rather than restoring those from lr, the wrong flags may be set when <CODE>ProcB</CODE> returns direct to <CODE>ProcA</CODE>'s caller. See <A HREF="#XREF17932">The ARM procedure call standard</A>).<P><P>
