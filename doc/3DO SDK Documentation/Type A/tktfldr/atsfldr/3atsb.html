<TITLE>Library File Format</TITLE><H1>Library File Format</H1><HR>For library files, the first part of each chunk's name is "LIB_"; for object libraries, the names of the additional two chunks begin with "OFL_".<P>Each piece of a library file is stored in a separate, identifiable chunk, named as follows:<P><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------Chunk        |Chunk Name                                --------------------------------------------------------Directory    |LIB_DIRY                                  --------------------------------------------------------Time stamp   |LIB_TIME                                  --------------------------------------------------------Version      |LIB_VSRN                                  --------------------------------------------------------Data         |LIB_DATA                                  --------------------------------------------------------Symbol table |OFL_SYMT (object code libraries only)     --------------------------------------------------------Time stamp   |OFL_TIME(object code libraries only)      --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P>There may be many LIB_DATA chunks in a library, one for each library member. In all chunks, word values are stored with the same byte order as the target system; strings are stored in ascending address order, which is independent of target byte order.<P><H2>LIB_DIRY</H2>The LIB_DIRY chunk contains a directory of the modules in the library, each of which is stored in a LIB_DATA chunk. The directory size is fixed when the library is created. The directory consists of a sequence of variable length entries, each an integral number of words long. The number of directory entries is determined by the size of the LIB_DIRY chunk. Pictorially:<P><PRE>-----------------------------------------------------ChunkIndex           |                               -----------------------------------------------------EntryLength          |the size of this LIB_DIRY chunk                     |(an integral number of words)  -----------------------------------------------------DataLength           |the size of the Data (an                            |integral number of words)      -----------------------------------------------------Data                 |                               -----------------------------------------------------</PRE><P>ChunkIndex is a word containing the 0-origin index within the chunk file header of the corresponding LIB_DATA chunk. Conventionally, the first 3 chunks of an OFL file are LIB_DIRY, LIB_TIME and LIB_VSRN, so <I>ChunkIndex</I> is at least 3. A ChunkIndex of 0 means the directory entry is unused.<P>The corresponding LIB_DATA chunk entry gives the offset and size of the library module in the library file.<P>EntryLength is a word containing the number of bytes in this LIB_DIRY entry, always a multiple of 4.<P>DataLength is a word containing the number of bytes used in the data section of this LIB_DIRY entry, also a multiple of 4.<P>The Data section consists of, in order:<P><UL><LI>a 0-terminated string (the name of the library member); <LI>any other information relevant to the library module (often empty);<LI>a 2-word, word-aligned time stamp.</UL>Strings should contain only ISO-8859 non-control characters (codes [0-31], 127 and 128+[0-31] are excluded).<P>The string field is the name used to identify this library module. Typically it is the name of the file from which the library member was created.<P>The format of the time stamp is described in <A HREF="#XREF15659">Time stamps</A>. Its value is an encoded version of the last-modified time of the file from which the library member was created.<P>To ensure maximum robustness with respect to earlier, now obsolete, versions of the ARM object library format:<P><UL><LI>Applications which create libraries or library members should ensure that the LIB_DIRY entries they create contain valid time stamps.<p><LI>Applications which read LIB_DIRY entries should not rely on any data beyond the end of the name string being present, unless the difference between the DataLength field and the name-string length allows for it. Even then, the contents of a time stamp should be treated cautiously and not assumed to be sensible.</UL>Applications which write LIB_DIRY or OFL_SYMT entries should ensure that padding is done with NUL (0) bytes; applications which read LIB_DIRY or OFL_SYMT entries should make no assumptions about the values of padding bytes beyond the first, string-terminating NUL byte.<P><A NAME="XREF15659"><H2>Time stamps </A></H2>A library time stamp is a pair of words encoding the following:<P><UL><LI>a 6-byte count of centi-seconds since the start of the 20th century;<LI>a 2-byte count of microseconds since the last centi-second (usually 0).</UL><IMG SRC="Figures/TimeStamps.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P>The first word stores the most significant 4 bytes of the 6-byte count; the least significant 2 bytes of the count are in the most significant half of the second word.<P>The least significant half of the second word contains the microsecond count and is usually 0.<P>Time stamp words are stored in target system byte order: they must have the same <I>endianness</I> as the containing chunk file.<P><H2>LIB_TIME </H2>The LIB_TIME chunk contains a 2-word time stamp recording when the library was last modified. It is, hence, 8 bytes long.<P><H2>LIB_VSRN</H2>The version chunk contains a single word whose value is 1.<P><H2>LIB_DATA</H2>A LIB_DATA chunk contains one of the library members indexed by the LIB_DIRY chunk. The endian-ness or byte order of this data is, by assumption, the same as the byte order of the containing library/chunk file.<P>No other interpretation is placed on the contents of a member by the library management tools. A member could itself be a file in chunk file format or even another library.<P><P>
