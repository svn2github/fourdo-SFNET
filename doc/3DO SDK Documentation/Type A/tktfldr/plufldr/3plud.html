In that case, you can edit an existing P-Mode preset or create a new one.<P>This section helps you work with P-Mode presets and discusses:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF15451">How to create a P-Mode preset</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF35227">Which cels allow P-Mode</A></UL><DL><DD><B>Note: </B>For more information on which cels allow P-Mode, see "Tools for 3DO Art Production," in "Introduction to 3DO Graphics" in this manual.<BR></DL><A NAME="XREF15451"><H2>How to create a P-Mode preset</A></H2>To create a new P-Mode Preset follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Start a save process to display the CelWriter dialog. <p><LI>Click New in the P-Mode Settings box in the bottom left of the dialog. <p><p>The P-Mode Preset dialog appears. <p><IMG SRC="Figures/PLU3.figs/CreatePreset.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>P-Mode Preset dialog.</I><P><LI>Give the new P-Mode preset a name, then adjust the settings in the dialog that appears for the desired effect.</OL><A NAME="XREF35227"><H2>Which cels allow P-Mode </A></H2>You can create a P-Mode channel for uncoded 16-bit cels and for coded 6-bit, 4-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit cels. However, if there are a lot of colors where you place the mask in the original image, you may potentially lose a lot of color resolution since P-Mode for the listed coded cel types is effectively computed on a per-color basis. <P>For 8-bit coded cels, there is no special P-Mode bit. However, the P-Mode pop-up menus in the Coded-8 CelWriter are provided as a convenience for the programmer. The programmer may decide to flip between P-Mode 1 and P-Mode 0 for the whole cel as part of the program. For example, the program could alternate between an opaque ghost and a translucent ghost if the two P-Modes had previously been specified. <P><H2>For more information </H2>For more detail on how the hardware uses two data sources and uses multipliers and dividers, see <I>Introduction to 3DO Graphics</I> in this volume. <P>
