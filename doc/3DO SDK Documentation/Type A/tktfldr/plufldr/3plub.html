In most situations, however, you don't want to move a rectangle around the screen but want to move an object like a UFO, a person, or a fish. <P>The 3DO hardware makes it easy to create irregularly shaped cels by offering two special features: <P><UL><LI>The hardware interprets all black pixels in a cel as transparent pixels by default. <p>  <LI>The hardware allows you to mark certain pixels in the cel explicitly as transparent using a special color.</UL><DL><DD><B>Note: </B>Using a special color is only possible for packed cels and currently implemented only for the Coded-8 CelWriter. It is, however, the most efficient way of creating an irregularly shaped cel. <BR></DL>As a result, you can create irregularly shaped cels two ways; and you will learn:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF19540">How to create an irregularly shaped cel (no true black in cel)</A>.<LI><A HREF="#XREF36014">How to use a special color for an irregularly shaped cel (Coded-8 CelWriter)</A>.</UL><A NAME="XREF19540"><H2>How to create an irregularly shaped cel (no true black in cel)</A></H2>To create an irregularly shaped cel with no true black-3DO hardware interprets black as transparent-follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>From the Image menu, choose Adjust, then Levels, from the submenu, and drag the Output Levels slider slightly to the right until the value is 9. (Alternately, change the Output Level from 0 to 9.)<p><p>This changes all black pixels (RGB 0-0-0) to mostly black (RGB 9-9-9) in the source art.
