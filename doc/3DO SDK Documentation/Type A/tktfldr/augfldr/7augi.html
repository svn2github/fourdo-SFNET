<TITLE>Repetitive assembly </TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF10886">Repetitive assembly </LINK></H1><HR>The conditional looping statement, useful for generating repetitive tables, is provided in the assembler by the WHILE...WEND directives. This produces an assembly-time loop, not a run-time loop. Because the test for the WHILE condition is made at the top of the loop, it is possible that no code will be generated during assembly; lines are listed as for conditional assembly. The syntax is:<P><CODE><PRE>WHILE</CODE></PRE><CODE><PRE>...code...WEND</CODE></PRE>
