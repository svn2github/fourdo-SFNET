<TITLE>The ARM Assembler (armasm)</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF22713">The ARM Assembler (armasm)</LINK></H1><HR>The ARM Assembler compiles ARM Assembly Language into object code in ARM Object Format. This is then suitable for linking by the ARM Linker, with (or without) other object code produced by either the ARM Assembler or ARM C Compiler, or with object libraries.<P>To see the <A HREF="./2auga.html#XREF29139">Command line options</A> for the ARM Assembler, click on the highlighted text. <P><H2>For more information</H2>For more information about ARM Assembly Language see and <A HREF="../acbfldr/acb2frst.html#XREF32584">Exploring ARM Assembly Language</A>.
