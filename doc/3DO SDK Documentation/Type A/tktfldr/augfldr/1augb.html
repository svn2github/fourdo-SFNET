<TITLE>Invoking armcc</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF21667">Invoking armcc</LINK></H1><HR>The general form of the command for invoking the ARM C compiler is:<P><CODE><PRE>armcc</CODE></PRE>By default, the C compiler looks for source files, and creates object, assembler and listing files, in the current directory.<P>Many aspects of the compiler's operation can be controlled via command-line options. All options are prefixed by a minus sign.<P>There are two classes of option: keywords and flags. Keywords are recognised in upper case or lower case. A flag is a single letter, the case of which is sometimes important to the ARM C compiler.<P>Because some systems (such as Unix) are very case sensitive, the case of flags is most important when you are building portable <I>makefiles</I>. By using the conventions common to many C compilers, you can move a makefile between different environments at minimum cost.<P><P>
