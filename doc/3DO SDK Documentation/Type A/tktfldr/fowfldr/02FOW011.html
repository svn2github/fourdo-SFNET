In the dialog that            |appears type in the number of pixels you               |want between characters (Character Spacing)            |or between lines (Character Leading), then             |choose OK.                                 --------------------------------------------------------Load Subset |If your title uses only a small amount of  File        |text, prepare a file that contains the text            |and load it using the Load Subset File                 |command. FontWriter sets the character                 |width for all characters not used in the               |subset file to zero so those characters                |will not be saved when you save the 3DO                |font. Make individual characters available             |again by using the character-width hook, or            |make all characters available with the                 |Recalculate Widths command. Change the                 |subset file and apply Load Subset File                 |again. The 3DO FontWriter recomputes the               |subset. This command lets you create a font            |with only the characters your title needs,             |effectively reducing the size of the font              |file.                                      --------------------------------------------------------Recalculate |Recomputes the character width so that all Widths      |parts of each character become visible. A              |dialog asks if you want to recalculate the             |entire character set, or the current                   |characters. Choose Current Characters if               |you're working with a subset font and have             |edited some of the visible characters to               |make all edits visible for just the visible            |characters. Choose Entire Character Set if             |you're working with a subset font but want             |to return to the font using all characters.            |                                           --------------------------------------------------------Get Font    |Displays style and size information about  Info        |the font.                                  --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><P>
