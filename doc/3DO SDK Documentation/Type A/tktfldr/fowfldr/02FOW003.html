For any font, the 3DO FontWriter stores only the pixels delineated by the actual character width for each character, not the area determined by Max Width and Max Height. If you set the width of a character to zero, that character isn't stored in the 3DO font file you save.<p><LI><B>Character baseline</B>-A small arrow to the right of the Character Edit window lets you move a horizontal line to specify the character's ascent and descent, and, in effect, the baseline. </UL><DL><DD><B>Note: </B>To change character width and height globally, reload the font and specify a different height and width.<BR></DL><H2>Choosing between a character and its shadow or outline</H2>If you're editing a font containing a separate shadow or outline image for each character, you can choose between editing either the character or the other image using the buttons in the bottom-left corner of the window. At start-up, the actual character is displayed. <P><IMG SRC="PICTS/FWCEWinL.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><P><B>Figure 3: </B><I>A character only display (left) and character and outline (right).</I><P>
