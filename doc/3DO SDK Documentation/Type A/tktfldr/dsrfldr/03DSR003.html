Available operations are the following:</DL><DL><DT>extract Extract cels from an ANIM or SANM input chunk file and write a cel into an individual chunk file in the specified output directory. Anti-aliased frames, consisting of a edge cel and a foreground cel, are written as two separate output files. Extract may also be performed against SCEL files, in which case each output file will contain a single SCEL cel-list chunk.</DL><DL><DT>extract_groups    Same as the extract operation, except anti-aliased cels are written as a single output file in the same format as a file written by the anti-aliased cel-writer Photoshop plug-in.</DL><DL><DT>stream_info Analyze a stream chunk file to determine the percent of filler versus data. This operation does not require the specification of an output directory.</DL><DL><DT>-if &lt;filename&gt;<DD>Specifies the input chunk file.</DL><DL><DT>-od &lt;directoryname&gt;<DD>Specifies the directory into which all of the output files will be written.</DL><DL><DT>-v<DD>Specifies verbose printing of progress information.</DL><DL><DT>-of &lt;filename&gt;<DD>Specifies an output file. This option is unused since none of the current operation modules require a separate output file.</DL>
