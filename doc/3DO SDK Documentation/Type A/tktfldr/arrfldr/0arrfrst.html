The following components of the toolkit are described in this manual:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="./arr1frst.html#XREF37859">The ARM C Compiler</A><LI><A HREF="./arr2frst.html#XREF25147">ARM C Library Porting Guide</A><LI><A HREF="./arr3frst.html#XREF25184">The ARM Linker</A></UL>This manual is intended as a reference guide for users of the ARM toolkit who require more detailed information than is represented in the User Manual.<P>This manual is intended to be used in conjunction with the rest of the ARM toolkit documentation, and also with the ARM datasheet relevant to the specific device being used.<P>Click on one of the topics below to select it: <P><UL><LI><A HREF="./arr1frst.html#XREF37859">The ARM C Compiler</A> is a reference guide to the ARM C cross compiler, and includes all the information required to make effective use of the ARM C system. <p><LI><A HREF="./arr2frst.html#XREF25147">ARM C Library Porting Guide</A> discusses source organization, building a target-specific library, retargetting a library, and details of target-dependent code. <p><LI><A HREF="./arr3frst.html#XREF25184">The ARM Linker</A> provided detailed information about the ARM linker and its use. </UL><H1>Information not included in this document</H1>This document is based on the ARM Reference Manual provided by ARM, with some additions.
