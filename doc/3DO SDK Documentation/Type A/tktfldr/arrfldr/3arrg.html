<TITLE>Plain binary format </TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF19244">Plain binary format</LINK> </H1><HR>An image in plain binary format is a sequence of bytes to be loaded into memory at a known address. How this address is communicated to the loader, and where to enter the loaded image, are not the business of the linker.<P>In order to produce a plain binary output there must be:<P><UL><LI>no unresolved symbolic references between the input objects, (each reference must resolve directly or via an input library);<p><LI>an absolute base address (given by the -Base option to <I>armlink</I>);<p><LI>complete performance of all relocation directives.</UL>Input areas having the read-only attribute are placed at the low-address end of the image; initialised writable areas follow; 0-initialised areas are consolidated at the end of the file where a block of zeroes of the appropriate size is written. <P><P>
