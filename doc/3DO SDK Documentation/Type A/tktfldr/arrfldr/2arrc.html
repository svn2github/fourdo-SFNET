<TITLE>Retargetting the library</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF19991">Retargetting the library</LINK></H1><HR><A NAME="XREF24503"><H2>Variant selection</A></H2>The following generic variants are available as 'tick box' options through the <I>options</I> file in the target directory:<P><H3>fp_type</H3><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------=linked   |causes the object module containing the                |floating point emulator to be included in the          |library (and linked into any image), along             |with a small interface module to take control          |of the illegal instruction vector on startup,          |and relinquish it on closedown.              --------------------------------------------------------=module   |floating point emulation is provided                   |externally in some way (present in ROM, for            |example). In this case, if the                         |target-dependent kernel follows the code of            |the riscos example, functions                          |__fp_initialise, __fp_finalise and                     |__fp_address_in_module must be provided.     --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><H3>memcpy</H3><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------=small    |memcpy, memmove and memset are implemented by          |generic C code (which attempts to do as much           |as possible in word units): each occupies              |about 100 bytes.                             --------------------------------------------------------=fast     |memmove and memcpy are implemented together            |in assembler, which attempts to do the bulk            |of the move 8 words at a time using LDM/STM            |(about 1200 bytes). memset is implemented              |similarly (about 200 bytes).                 --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><H3>divide</H3><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------=small     |the fully rolled implementations.           --------------------------------------------------------=unrolled  |unsigned and signed divide are unrolled 8              |times for greater speed, but obviously use             |more code. Complete unrolling of divide is             |possible, but should be done with care since           |the significant size increase might give               |decreased rather than increased performance            |on a cached ARM. Whichever variant is                  |selected, fast unsigned and signed divide by           |10 are included.                            --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><H3>stack=</H3>(see later subsection Address Space Model).<P><H3>stdfile_redirection</H3><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------=on  |_main extracts Unix-style stdstream connection         |directives from the image's argument string (&lt;         |, &gt;, &gt;&gt;, &gt;&amp;, 1&gt;&amp;2).           --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><H3>backtrace</H3><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------=on  |the default signal handler ends by producing a         |call-stack traceback to stderr. (Use of this           |variant is not encouraged, since it increases the      |proportion of the library that is linked into all      |images, while providing functionality better           |obtained from a separate debugger).               --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><H2>Basic choices</H2>After the tick box choices have been made, basic choices then have to be made about the address-space model and the I/O model the library will follow.<P><H2>Address space model</H2>Two address space models are supported: contiguous stack and chunked stack.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/ARR.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P>A third variant, like the first, but with the stack outside of the heap and not under the application's control, can easily be synthesised. This may be a more appropriate variant if there is a skeletal operating system which implements an address-mapped stack segment.<P><H2>I/O model</H2>The library, as supplied, only conveniently handles byte-stream files, (which is not to say that other file types can not be handled in the target-dependent IO support level, but such support may well be complicated; block stream files, for example, are simple to support in the absence of user-supplied buffers).<P><P>
