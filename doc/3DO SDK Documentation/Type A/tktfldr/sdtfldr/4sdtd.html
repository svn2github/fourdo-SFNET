Since the actual process of editing the MIDI files depends on the sequencer you have available, this section only gives a brief overview of the process:<P><UL><LI>Connect the Output of the MIDI sequencer to the Input of ARIA, using the Apple MIDI Manager's PatchBay application. <p><LI>Load the MIDI file you want to edit into the MIDI sequencer (or start composing a new document).<p><LI>Make sure a MIDI project document is the topmost document in ARIA. <p><LI>Make sure there is a PIMap in the MIDI project window and that the PIMap is loaded into 3DO memory (see <A HREF="./4sdtc.html#XREF41645">Playing a MIDI file on the 3DO Station</A>.)<p><LI>You do not need to attach a MIDI file to the MIDI project document; MIDI is interpreted in real-time from the sequencer or keyboard. </UL><DL><DD><B>Note: </B>Running real-time MIDI is more reliable if the MIDI Manager Patchbay application is up and running before any of the other programs are launched.<BR></DL><TITLE></TITLE><H1></H1><HR>
