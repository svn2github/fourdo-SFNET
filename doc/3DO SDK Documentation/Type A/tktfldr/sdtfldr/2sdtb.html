<TITLE>Setup for working with MIDI</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF25707"></LINK><LINK NAME="XREF28535">Setup for working with MIDI</LINK></H1><HR>This section explains some system setup for working with MIDI. It is recommended you go through the setup now even if you don't expect to work with MIDI immediately.<P><A NAME="XREF38788"><H2>Files and folder setup</A></H2>If you expect to use samples to play MIDI, you need to copy some files into folders that ARIA creates the first time it launches successfully. <P>To move the files and folders, go through these steps:<P><OL><LI>In the <I>/remote</I> folder, locate the following folders which ARIA has created: <p><DL><DD><UL><LI><I>/remote/ARIA/Instruments</I><LI><I>/remote/ARIA/Samples</I><LI><I>/remote/ARIA/MIDI</I></UL><BR></DL><p><LI>Drag the contents of the </I><I>ARIA MIDI Examples</I> folder into the new<I> MIDI </I>folder. <p><LI>Drag any samples from the Toolkit CD-ROM that you expect to use to the <I>Samples</I> folder. </OL><H3>How ARIA uses the folders</H3>When ARIA compiles patches, it creates files it places in the<I> Instruments</I> folder. ARIA also places a file there each time you save a patch as a Macintosh document. You can open the Macintosh document for further work with ARIA but have to use the file in the <I>Instruments</I> folder to play on the 3DO Station. <P><H2>Required files for real-time MIDI</H2>If you intend to use ARIA to create patch documents for making sound effects or to play back standard MIDI files from disk, the folder structure described above is sufficient. <P>If you want to create music using ARIA's real-time MIDI capabilities, you also need the following: <P><UL><LI>Apple MIDI manager, including PatchBay, and the Apple MIDI driver, if it is needed by the sequencer. Apple MIDI manager is available from the Apple Developer's Association (1-800-282-2732).<p><LI>A MIDI sequencer compatible with MIDI Manager, as described in <A HREF="./sdt4frst.html#XREF34368">Creating MIDI Projects with ARIA</A>.<p><LI>A MIDI keyboard.</UL><A NAME="XREF11430"><H2>Setting up for MIDI</A></H2>For real-time MIDI playback from a sequencer, or to play a patch from a MIDI keyboard, you will need the following:<P><UL><LI>Apple MIDI Driver in your <I>System</I> folder. <LI>Apple MIDI Manager in your <I>Extensions</I> folder.<LI>PatchBay application. Consider placing it in your <I>Apple Menu Items</I> folder for easy access. </UL>These programs are available separately and are usually bundled with sequencer applications. <P>Figure 1 below shows the PatchBay window set up for all possible uses with ARIA.<P>The individual connections have the following effect:<P><UL><LI>Serial port to sequencer-used for composing with your sequencer.<LI>Sequencer to ARIA-real-time playback from sequencer.<LI>Serial port to ARIA-playback of patches from MIDI keyboard.</UL><IMG SRC="Figures/Ch2figs/patchBay.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>PatchBay setup for working with ARIA.</I><P><B>Warning: </B>If you are using all three of these connections, consider turning off the keyboard "tru" option in the sequencer to avoid "note bounce." <P>
