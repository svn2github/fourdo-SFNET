In earlier versions the sample file was allowed not to be embedded, which meant that you had the same folder structure when you created the patch as when you played it.<BR><p><LI>Connect knobs, sampler, and Output block as explained in <A HREF="./3stdb.html#XREF35120">Creating your first patch</A>. </OL><IMG SRC="Figures/Ch3figs/SamplePatch.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Patch with Sample block.</I><P><A NAME="XREF27189"><H2>Compiling and playing the sampler patch</A></H2>To hear the whole patch on the 3DO Station:<P><OL><LI>From the File menu, choose Save to save the patch as a Macintosh file. <p><LI>From the Patch menu, select Compile Patch. <p><LI>From the Patch menu, use Start Patch (and Stop Patch) to play the patch- or press the Space bar to start the patch, then press it twice more to release and stop it.</OL><H2>Tips and tricks</H2>This section gives a few tips and trips for working with sampler patches. <P><H3>Experimenting with other blocks </H3>Creating patches becomes more interesting if you use filter blocks to filter out part of the sample or envelopes to modify its frequency or amplitude. Using envelopes is explained in the next section. <P><H3>Making a sample part of a PIMap</H3>You can create a patch with no sample in the sample block and make it part of a PIMap you use to play a MIDI file. See <A HREF="#XREF15081">MIDI files and PIMap files</A>.<P><H3>Creating a multisample instrument</H3>If you plan to create a multisample instrument from a patch, the patch must not have a sample assigned to it when you compile it. You must attach the samples to the instruments in the PIMap, with their note ranges and other parameters specified there. <P>The patch names on such samples must be correct in your PIMap, and must be inside the <I>/remote</I> folder. <P>
