<TITLE>Preparing Audio</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF33307">Preparing Audio</LINK></H1><HR><H2>Mastering audio</H2>To  master audio, record at 44.1 kHz and use a DAT machine with digital I/O capabilities, like the Panasonic SV 3700. Then transfer your recordings digitally to the Macintosh. Sound files and samples should be normalized to maximum amplitude to take full advantage of the 16-bit dynamic range.<P><H2>Editing Synthesized Audio</H2>The AudioMedia system from DigiDesign is highly recommended for editing synthesized audio. It supports a variety of sample formats, has simple but powerful editing capabilities, and can record or play back digital or analog sound.<P>SoundEdit Pro from Macromedia works with all types of AIFF files and performs best with 8-bit, 22 Khz files.  <P>SoundEdit uses different algorithms to resample a file and to cut and paste between different sample rate files. If you resample a file to a different bit depth/sampling rate, SoundEdit may add aliasing and degrade the sound.<P>Use the following method for better results:<P><OL><LI>Create a new empty file.<LI>Double-click the bit depth/sample rate icon in the lower-left corner of the new file's window.<LI>Change the file's bit depth/sample rate as desired.<LI>Return to the original file.<LI>Select all.<LI>Copy.<LI>Go to the new file.<LI>Paste.</OL>For sample rate conversion, use SoundHack or SoundDesigner. An early bug in SoundHack that caused a pop at the beginning has been fixed.<P><P>
