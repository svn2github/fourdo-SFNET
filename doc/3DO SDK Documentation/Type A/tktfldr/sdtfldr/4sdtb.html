<TITLE>MIDI files and PIMap files</TITLE><H1>MIDI files and PIMap files</H1><HR>To play a MIDI file on the 3DO Station, you need the following files:<P><UL><LI>The MIDI file itself<p><LI>The PIMap (program-instrument map file), which tells the 3DO system how to match MIDI numbers with sounds<p><LI>Compiled patches (.ins) or samples referred to in the PIMap</UL>This section discusses the PIMap file format, including the currently supported flags and an example file. <P><H2>Working with PIMaps</H2>A PIMap associates MIDI program numbers with 3DO instruments. <P><H3>Parts of a PIMap</H3>A PIMap consists of several lines, separated by carriage returns. Each line contains: <P><UL><LI>MIDI program number (1-128)<LI>Filename<p><UL><LI>If the filename ends in .aiff, .aif, or .aifc, it is considered to be the name of a sample file and the file is attached to the appropriate sample player instrument. <p><LI>If the filename does not end in .aiff, .aif, or .aifc, it is assumed to be an instrument name. For example, if the file ends in <I>.ins</I>, it is a compiled ARIA patch. </UL><BR><p><LI>Optional flags </UL></UL><H3>Currently supported flags</H3>The following table lists the flags that are currently supported as part of a PIMap:<P><PRE><B>Table 1: </B><I> Flags in a PIMap.</I>--------------------------------------------------------Flag   |Description                                     ---------------------------------------------------------f     |Play sample file using a fixed-rate sample             |player that uses fewer ticks than a                    |variable-rate player would                      ---------------------------------------------------------m n   |Set maximum number of voices (default is 1)     ---------------------------------------------------------l n   |Set low note for a sample                       ---------------------------------------------------------b n   |Set base note for a sample                      ---------------------------------------------------------h n   |Set high note for a sample                      ---------------------------------------------------------p n   |Set priority for instrument, default = 100, max        |= 200                                           ---------------------------------------------------------d     |Set a detune value.

The following points are of interest: <P><UL><LI>The PIMap file assigns the appropriate samples to the different ranges of the instrument. <p><LI>Each .aiff file covers no more than a half octave, as you can see when you look at the low notes, base notes, and high notes assigned to the different .aiff files.<p><LI>The gong is fixed pitch.<p><LI>The clarinet is set up as a multisample with octave spacing.<p><LI>The organ has its MaxVoices set to 4 to make it possible to play chords.<p><LI>The sample <I>bell.aiff</I> is played by the instrument <I>varmono16.dsp</I> because the instrument is specified before the sample is specified. <p><LI>The instrument ending in <I>.ins</I> (<I>windnoise.ins</I>) is a compiled ARIA instrument. </UL><B>Example 1: </B><I>PIMap example file.</I><P><CODE><PRE>1 clarinet1.aiff -l 30 -b 48 -h 531 clarinet2.aiff -l 54 -b 60 -h 661 clarinet3.aiff -l 67 -b 72 -h 842 gong.aiff -f3 bass.aiff -p 1504 organ.aiff -m 45 varmono16.dsp5 bell.aiff6 sawenv.dsp7 windnoise.ins</CODE></PRE><B>Note: </B>In addition to .aiff files, you can also use instruments you previously created in ARIA (.ins files). The last line of the example above illustrates this. <P>
