It helps nonprogrammers understand the principles behind audio on the 3DO system and gives references to the appropriate sections of the <I>3DO Portfolio Programmer's Guide</I> for more in-depth coverage. <P><H2>Playing MIDI scores </H2>The 3DO system is set up to allow MIDI score playing, which is more interactive than spooling. You can use the ARIA tool to develop synthetic patches (instruments) or to attach sample files to MIDI notes.<P>You can attach MIDI notes to synthetic sounds or AIFF samples, depending on RAM availability and system resources. Synthetic instruments take the least amount of RAM, but may result in involve a small processing overhead. On the Toolkit 1.4 CD-ROM (and later), you can find a library of AIFF samples to use in your titles. An overview is provided in <A HREF="sdtBfrst.html#XREF25541">AIFF Samples</A> .<P>You can use hierarchical score structures for dramatic construction; for more information, see the documentation on the Music Library.<P><H2>Streaming audio data with the 3DO DataStreamer</H2>You can fade or mix several channels of digital audio samples for dramatic purposes, but remember bandwidth limitations. The <I>3DO Data Streamer Programmer's Guide</I> discusses data streaming and provides manpages for all relevant functions in the DataStreamer library. <P><A NAME="XREF42313"></A>
