Make sure you don't use a tool that compresses video while digitizing-compressing video twice is always unsatisfactory, even if it's uncompressed as an intermediate step. If video was generated from a movie with the Telecine process, use the 3-2 Pulldown tool to remove superfluous frames.<P><A NAME="XREF35809"><H3>Artwork</A></H3>Start artwork at a high resolution and then convert it. Remove NTSC hot colors. In some cases, you may need to use anti-aliased cels which you can generate with the Anti-Alias CelWriter plug-in. <P><A NAME="XREF20780"><H3>Audio</A></H3><A NAME="XREF15333">Sample audio at 44 kHz and convert it to lower sample rates as appropriate. </A>Deciding on the optimal compression may require some experimentation. Here's some information to help you decide on compression rate:<P>CD quality stereo requires 176 KB/s.<P>The lowest quality sound currently offered(22 K Mono 4:1) is acceptable for voice in most cases. <P>Most music can use 22 K 16-bit stereo 2:1 compressed (44KB/s data rate). High frequencies are attenuated, but not usually too much. <P>Most audio sounds better at 2:1 compression than at 4:1. 22 KB 2:1 sounds better than 44 KB 4:1-and they have the same data rate.<P><H3>For more information</H3>Data generation issues are discussed in more detail in, for example, Chapter 1 of the  3DO Tools for Sound Designers volume and the <I>Introduction to 3DO Graphics</I>  and <I>Video Processing Guide </I>in the 3DO Tools for Art Production volume.<P><A NAME="XREF12972"><H2>Converting data to 3DO format</A></H2>Before you can create chunk files from data, you have to convert them to 3DO format and compress them where appropriate. The 3DO Toolkit CD-ROM offers a variety of tools for converting still art, video, and audio. The related documentation provides detailed information on using those tools. <P>Click on one of the following topics for more information: <P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF16522">Still photo</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF31009">Video and animation</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF28804">Audio</A></UL><A NAME="XREF16522"><H3>Still photo</A></H3>Convert to cel of your choice using one of the following:<P>3DO custom plug-ins <P>3DO CCM for DeBabelizer (batch process)<P>3DO ppm utilities<P>3DO Animator or 3DO PostPro (see <I>3DO Release Notes</I>) <P><A NAME="XREF31009"><H3>Video and animation</A></H3>Convert a video or animation to a series of cels using the 3DO CCM for Debabelizer or 3DO Animator. <P>Convert a video or animation to a compressed movie using the following tools from 3DO Toolkit 1.4 or later:<P>MovieEdit to fine-tune the movie<P>3:2 Pulldown if the movie was based on a film<P>MovieCompress to compress<P>Convert Macromedia Director animations using Director Extractor. <P><A NAME="XREF28804"><H3>Audio</A></H3>Use 3DO SoundHack to converts files to 22.5 kHz AIFF (and compress if desired).<P>Use Adobe Premier to extract an AIFF file from a movie. <P>If you work with a Macintosh sound resource, you may need to resample to generate a 22.05 kHz AIFF file. <P><A NAME="XREF38695"><H2>Compressing data</A></H2>Compression can usually be done as part of the data conversion process. For example, when you convert sound to 3DO format using the SoundHack tool, you can choose between 2:1 and 4:1 compression. The following table illustrates the choices you have.<P><PRE><B>Table 1: </B><I> Compression tools.</I>--------------------------------------------------------Data    |Tool                                           type    |                                               --------------------------------------------------------Cel     |Many cel types with different resolutions are          |available.The Introduction to 3DO Graphics             |manual in the 3DO Tools for Art Production             |volume discusses different cel types and their         |use in some detail.                            --------------------------------------------------------Video   |MovieCompress compresses movies.

The tools shown in the following table convert data to chunked, timestamped files that the Weaver tool can then weave into a stream.<P><PRE><B>Table 2: </B><I> Data conversion tools.</I>--------------------------------------------------------Tool          |Description                              --------------------------------------------------------MovieToStream |Converts QuickTime movie compressed with               |MovieCompress into a stream compatible                 |with CPakSubscriber.c. Note that                       |MovieToStream only deals with the video                |data; you must extract and process audio               |data separately.                         --------------------------------------------------------SFToStream    |Converts AIFF/AIFC data into a stream                  |compatible with SAudioSubscriber.c.      --------------------------------------------------------Chunkify      |Takes any kind of input data, and breaks               |it up into stream blocks so that the Join              |subscriber can load the data into RAM                  |over time.  The Join subscriber is found               |in JoinSubscriber.c.                     --------------------------------------------------------SANMMaker     |Generates a file you can play back with                |SANMSubscriber.c. Note that in most                    |cases, StreamMaker, which can be found in              |the Attic folder, produces better                      |results.                                 --------------------------------------------------------CtlMaker      |Generates chunk data for the Control                   |subscriber.                              --------------------------------------------------------StreamMaker   |Accepts a script that describes how to                 |combine cels into frames and how to                    |combine other different chunks of data                 |into a stream. You can combine Cel chunks              |as well as Join, Cinepak, Audio, Score,                |Text, and SANM chunks. The resulting file              |can be submitted to the Weaver tool.     --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><A NAME="XREF35030"><B>Note: </B>The ARIA tool makes it possible to read a MIDI file and write a score file.
