<TITLE>Why use the DataStreamer?</TITLE><H1>Why use the DataStreamer?</H1><HR>This section illustrates when data streaming is useful by discussing the following topics:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF26572">Examples for using the DataStreamer</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF33483">Future development</A></UL><A NAME="XREF26572"><H2>Examples for using the DataStreamer</A></H2>The DataStreamer is useful for all applications that need to play back synchronized data of different types: video, audio, 3DO cels and animations, and so on. <P>The DataStreamer consists of a library and a number of examples. You can use these examples with minimal modification to stream your data to the 3DO system. Here's a list of examples including names of relevant example programs:<P><UL><LI>Play a full-screen digital video sequence with sound. (Streaming:<I>version</I>:Examples:NuPlayer)<p><LI>Play a digitized cel animation with sound. (Attic:<I>version</I>:Examples:SCelPlayer)<p><LI>Play a video with multi-channel audio. <p><LI>Play a simple video while loading data (never say "Please wait").<p><LI>Play a video that allows start, stop, fast forward, rewind, and branch. (Streaming:<I>version</I>:Examples:ShuttlePlayer)<p><LI>Play a video with synchronized text (Attic:<I>version</I>:Examples:TextPlayer)</UL>More extensive additions to the available source code make it possible to stream any kind of data you need. For example, if you have a proprietary software compression algorithm, you can modify the DataStreamer to play back video compressed with your codec, synchronized with sound. <P><A NAME="XREF33483"><H2>Future development</A></H2>In the future, you should expect the capability to play back hardware, compressed video (MPEG), and video compressed by other codecs than Cinepak. There will also be more control over timing. <P>See the <I>3DO Release Notes</I> for more information. <P><TITLE></TITLE><H1></H1><HR>
