<TITLE>MovieCompress</TITLE><H1>MovieCompress</H1><HR><H2>Movie Compression Settings dialog options</H2><p>MovieCompress compresses movies using any of the Apple QuickTime codecs. It lets you specify frame rate, key frame rate, data rate, depth, and codec. This section provides a table of relevant information for each option available during compression.

Use it to choose between color and grayscale or to select the color depth to be used. <P><H3>Compression quality</H3>The Quality slider lets you choose between high-quality slow compression and low-quality fast compression. <P><H3>Frames per second</H3>The<I> </I>Frames per second pop-up lets you select a frame rate. You can also type in the desired frame rate. Whatever your source frame rate setting is, your destination rate remains the same. That is, if your source is at 30 fps, your destination is also 30 fps.<P><B>Note: </B>For smooth displays, pick a frame rate that's divisible by two, because you must eliminate every other frame to end up with smooth transitions between frames. For example, if the original rate was 24, pick 12; if the original rate was 30, pick 15. <P><H3>Key frame settings</H3>The Key frame settings option lets you specify how many key frames should be preserved during compression. Choose a high number if there's a lot of motion in the movie, a lower rate if not. <P><H3>Data rate limitation </H3>This section lets you specify at what data rate the compressed movie will be played.<P><A NAME="XREF37277"><H2>Example for using the MovieCompress Tool </A></H2>This section illustrates the compression of a sample movie with Cinepak. The settings used in this example are listed below: <P><UL><LI>Compression: Cinepak, color <LI>Quality: Normal<LI>Motion: <UL><LI>Frames per second: Best<LI>Key frame every 24 frames<LI>Limit data rate to 210 K/second </UL><BR></UL><H3>How to compress a movie</H3>To compress a movie, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Drag your source movie on top of the MovieCompress icon. <p><p>The Compression Settings dialog appears. <p><IMG SRC="Figures/VID5.figs/VID.Settings.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Compression Settings dialog.</I><P><LI>From compression algorithm pop-up- set to Video by default- choose Cinepak. <p><LI>Select color. <p><LI>Leave the Quality slider at normal. <p><LI>In the Motion section, leave Frames per second at Best (the default setting). <p><p>If you choose Best, MovieCompress keeps the original movie's number of frames per second. <p><LI>Set key frame every 24 frames. <p><LI>Limit the data rate to 210 K/second. <p><p>This leaves 90 K/Second for the stereo audio track. <p><LI>Click OK and a second dialog appears, prompting you for a destination file.<p><LI>Specify the destination file and you're done.<p><p>A progress dialog is visible as compression takes place. <p></OL>
