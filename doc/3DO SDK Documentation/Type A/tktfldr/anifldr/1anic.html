<TITLE>Creating a simple coded cel</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF38335">Creating a simple coded cel</LINK></H1><HR>This section first provides some background information, then steps you through creating a simple coded cel. <P><H2>Introduction</H2>Coded 3DO cels are indexed into a palette. When you create a coded cel, 3DO Animator always has to first compute the palette; after that you can remap the document. <P><H3>Available palette colors for different cel types</H3>The number of available colors for the palette of a coded cel depends on the cel type you select. Here's an overview of the available colors for different cels: <P><UL><LI>8-bit coded and 6-bit coded: 32 colors<LI>4-bit coded: 16 colors<LI>2-bit coded: 4 colors<LI>1-bit coded: 2 colors</UL><H3>Saving coded cels and saving palettes</H3>When you save a coded cel, 3DO Animator always automatically saves the palette associated with it. The 3DO system knows how to use the palette information in the file to display the cel on the 3DO screen using colors that are close to the original. <P>If a palette works out well for a cel, you can save and load it using the Save Palette and Load Palette buttons in the Functions area of the Set 3DO Cel Type dialog, as discussed in the section <A HREF="#XREF38179">Saving and loading palettes</A>. This is particularly useful when you're working with an animation. <P><H2>How to create a coded cel</H2>To convert 32-bit source art to an 8-bit coded cel, follow these steps: <P><OL><LI>Launch 3DO Animator and select Open in the New Document dialog that appears, then find the file in the file selection dialog and choose OK. <P>If 3DO Animator is already open, choose Open from the File menu. <P><LI>Type 3 to display the Set 3DO Object Type dialog if it's not currently visible. <LI>From the Cel Type pop-up in the dialog, choose Coded 8.<LI>Click the Best Palette button in the dialog.<P>A process method dialog appears. <P><LI>Choose Optimized Version (3DO). <P>3DO Animator computes a palette based on the colors in the source art. For an 8-bit coded cel, 3DO Animator creates a palette with 32 base colors and 7 shades of each color, as shown in Figure 4. Once the calculation is complete, the "best" palette is displayed in the palette grid of the Set 3DO Object Type dialog. The artwork is not remapped, however, until you click the Remap Document button. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh1/Set3DOfor8bit.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Set 3DO Object Type dialog for an 8-bit coded cel. </I><P><LI>Click the Remap Document button, then select Optimized Version (3DO) from the Process Method dialog. <P>A second dialog appears, prompting for special mapping parameters.<P><LI>Since you're not currently planning on using Transparency or Translucency options, leave the defaults in the dialog. <P>3DO Animator creates a new document and names it with an extension Coded8.<P><LI>If you're satisfied with the newly mapped document, save it choosing Save from the File menu. <P>If you're not satisfied, you can edit the palette, then update the document, as discussed in <A HREF="./1anid.html#XREF12415">Customizing a palette</A>. <P>
