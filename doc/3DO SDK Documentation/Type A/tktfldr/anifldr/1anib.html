However, if you first resize source art appropriately (320 x 240 if using an NTSC display), the 3DO hardware will treat source art saved as a 16-bit uncoded cel as an image. <P><H3>For more information</H3>For more information on how to decide which cel type to use, see <A HREF="../ginfldr/0ginfrst.html">Introduction to 3DO Graphics</A>  <P><H2>Converting 32-bit source art to a 16-bit uncoded cel</H2>When you convert 32-bit source art to a 16-bit uncoded cel, 3DO Animator has to reduce the colors.
