Figure 1 shows all commands in the Selection menu.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/Selectionmenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Selection menu.</I><P><H2>Selection menu commands discussed in this section</H2>The following commands in the Selection menu are discussed in this section:<P><UL><LI>Apply Selection to All Frames<LI>How to Apply a Move to All Frames<LI>How to Apply a Resize to All Frames</UL><H2>The Apply Selection to All Frames command</H2>When you select Apply Selection to All Frames, the command becomes selected and a check mark appears next to it. After that, your selection are applied to all frames. For example, if you flip a selected portion of the image on the current frame, all the frames will show the same portion as flipped.<P>When you select Apply Selection to All Frames, How to Apply a Move to All Frames and How to Apply a Resize to All Frames become available.<P><B>Note: </B>Be sure to deselect Apply Selection to All Frames when you have finished global processing.<P>When Apply Selection to All Frames is checked, some of the processing features in the Selection menu are disabled because they are not yet supported for full animation. Deselect the option Apply Selection to All Frames to reenable them.<P><H2>The How to Apply a Move to All Frames command</H2>When you select How to Apply a Move to All Frames, 3DO Animator displays the dialog shown in Figure 2. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/HowApplyMove.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 2: </B><I>How to Apply a Move to All Frames dialog. </I><P>Make the appropriate choices. For example, assume you have an animation created from a video of a person walking. To realign all the frames, choose to align the top-left corners of each frame. <P><B>Note: </B>To work with this option, you have to work on a clean animation-that is, without any pixels that are not part of the person and that could possibly be selected during the process.<P><H2>The How to Apply a Resize to All Frames command</H2>When you select How to Apply a Resize to All Frames, 3DO Animator displays a dialog shown in Figure 3.<P><UL><LI>If you select Keep Proportions, and "by applying the same w," the frames' relation to each other remains the same. For example, if you reduce the width of a shape by 20 pixels, the width of that shape is reduced on each frame by 20 pixels. The height then changes proportionally. <P><LI>If you select "No proportions kept," 3DO Animator reduces the selection in each frame by the number of pixels specified; however, it does not adjust the height.</UL><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/HowApplyResize.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 3: </B><I>How to Apply a Resize to Each Frame dialog. </I><P>
