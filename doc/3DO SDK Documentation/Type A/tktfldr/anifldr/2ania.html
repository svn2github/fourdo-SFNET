Making images that differ slightly from frame to frame and playing them back in rapid succession creates the illusion of motion.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh2/ANI.Flipbook.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Basic flip-book animation. </I><P><H2>Disk space considerations</H2>Animations use a lot of disk space because each frame is usually a separate file. You should therefore choose the resolution and document size wisely:<P><UL><LI>Use 256 colors when working with animations that you later want to save in 3DO file format. Consider setting your Preferences to 8 bits per pixel if you work with 3DO animations frequently.<P> <LI>Don't work with a larger page size than you need. </UL><H2>Overview of creating animations with 3DO Animator</H2>There are several ways to create animations using 3DO Animator: <P><UL><LI>Use 3DO Animator to create a flip-book animation.<P> <LI>Load a QuickTime movie file and make changes as desired, then save the file in 3DO file format.<P><LI>Use the Build an Animation command in the File menu to create an animation from a series of sequentially numbered PICT files. Make changes as needed, then save in 3DO format.<P><LI>Use the Quick Build 3DO Anim command in the 3DO Options menu to automatically concatenate 3DO cels in a specified folder (see page ).</UL><H2>Special features for processing animations with 3DO Animator</H2>3DO Animator offers several processing options that apply to all the frames of an animation: <P><UL><LI>Move or resize a selection in all frames of an animation by choosing Apply Selection to All Frames (Selection menu).<P><LI>Replace colors in all frames of an animation by choosing All Frames in the Replace Colors dialog available from the Colors menu.<P><LI>Trace part of a digitized movie and use the drawing as a separate document by using the light table (Animation menu). </UL><B>Note: </B>For information on specific menu commands and options see <A HREF="./ani5frst.html#XREF35882">Menu Commands and Dialogs</A>.<P>
