Figure above shows that you're on frame 1 of a 10-frame animation (1/10).<P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh2/AnimControl.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 2: </B><I>Anim control panel. </I><P><B>Note: </B>If you have problems creating an animation, start with a smaller document or a lower number of frames. <P><A NAME="XREF36623"><H2>Painting one frame at a time</A></H2>The simplest way to create an animation is to paint one frame at a time. <P><OL><LI>Double-click the Brush tool (see Figure 3). <P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh2/SelectBrush.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 3: </B><I>Tool palette with Brush tool selected. </I><P><LI>Select the largest round brush from the Choose Brush dialog that appears (see Figure 4). <P><IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh2/ChooseBrush.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 4: </B><I>Choose Brush dialog. </I><P><LI>Click Choose (or press Return) to set your selection.<P><LI>Paint a dot in the upper-left area of the open document. <P>You just placed a dot on frame 1. The trick of animation is to paint a slightly different picture on successive frames. Now you need to move to the next frame.<P><LI>Click the Next Frame button on the control panel.<P> <LI>The counter on the panel changes from 1/10 to 2/10 and a fresh, blank screen (frame 2) replaces the one with the dot on it (frame 1). <P><LI>Paint a dot to the right of where the first dot was.</OL><H3>Using keyboard shortcuts to move between frames</H3>You now have a dot on frame 1 and a dot on frame 2.<P>To complete a 10-frame animation of a dot that moves across the screen, you need eight more frames. To speed things up, use keyboard commands as follows: <P><OL><LI>Position the brush to the right of the dot you just painted on frame 2. <P><LI>Press Command - 3 to move to the next frame and click the mouse to paint a new dot. <P><LI>Repeat this sequence, pressing Command - 3 until the first dot appears again at the left side of the screen. The frame counter in the control panel reads 1/10 to show you are back at the first frame. <P></OL>You have just created an animation. <P><A NAME="XREF39604"><H2>Playing an animation</A></H2>You can play an animation in various ways: <P><UL><LI>Click the Play Once button in the control panel to see the dot moving quickly from left to right across the screen. <P><LI>Click the Play Continuously button to loop through the animation.<P><LI>Click Play Ping Pong to play the animation, then play it backwards. </UL><H3>Adjusting playback speed</H3>If your animation plays too quickly, it may be because the speed adjustment scroll bar is set, by default, at the relatively fast playback speed of 30 frames per second. <P>To slow down the playback speed, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Use the mouse to slowly drag the speed adjustment scroll bar all the way to the left.<P><LI>When the bar is completely white, the number 1 appears at its left. <P>You have set the playback speed to one (1) frame per second (fps). To increase the playback speed, drag the bar to the right with the mouse cursor. <P><LI>Adjust the speed to 4 frames per second.<P> <LI>Click the Play Continuously button to view the animation at that speed. <P><LI>To stop the animation, press any key or click the mouse.</OL><A NAME="XREF21192"><H2>Saving an animation</A></H2>You can save an animation in the following file formats:<P><UL><LI>3DO cel/animation<P><LI>3DO image/animation<P><LI>VDAN<P></UL><B>Note: </B>The type of format you choose depends on the type of file you have created. For more information on cels and images, see <A HREF="./ani1frst.html#XREF20467">Creating 3DO Images and Cels.</A> <P><H3>How to save an animation</H3>To save an animation in 3DO format, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>From the 3DO Options menu, choose Access 3DO Palette, then Show/Hide 3DO Palette (or type 3).<P> <LI>Choose the cel type and resolution you want to use.<P>Choosing an 8-bit coded cel or a cel of smaller resolution is highly recommended to save space. <P><LI>Choose Remap Document. <P>3DO Animator creates a new document in which all the frames have been mapped to a new color palette. <P><LI>Choose Save As, then select 3DO cel/animation or 3DO image/animation from the File Type pop-up menu. <P><LI>Click the Save button. </OL>
