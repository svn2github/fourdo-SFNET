Although pagetab.s generates ARM600 page tables, it is not the format of the page tables which is being discussed in this recipe, but how they are generated using <B>armasm</B>.  To find out more about ARM600 page tables please refer to the ARM600 datasheet.<P><H2>Repetitive assembly</H2>The following code fragment is taken from <I>pagetab.s</I>:<P>    <CODE><PRE>           GBLA    countercounter    SETA 0           WHILE   counter &lt;= 3           L1Entry SECTION, (counter:SHL:20), 0, U_BIT+C_BIT+B_BIT, SVC_RWcounter    SETA counter+1           WEND</CODE></PRE><H3>Explanation</H3>GBLA counter declares a global numeric variable called <I>counter </I>which is initialized to zero using the SETA directive.<P>The WHILE ... WEND construct is then used to repeatedly assemble the lines between WHILE and WEND.<P>In this example, the loop body is assembled for counter = 0, 1, 2 and 3, but because the looping condition is checked at the top of the loop, it is possible for code between a WHILE and a WEND never to be assembled. For example, if <I>counter</I> were initialized to 4, the body of the WHILE ... WEND loop would not be assembled at all.<P>Each time around the loop the macro <I>L1Entry</I> is called (with 5 arguments), and then <I>counter</I> is incremented.<P><H2>Macro usage and conditional assembly</H2>The following code fragment for L1Entry is also taken from <I>pagetab.s</I>:<P><CODE><PRE>MACROL1Entry $type, $addr, $dom, $ucb, $accIF ($type=SECTION)    DCD ((($addr):AND:&amp;FFF00000):OR:(($acc):SHL:10) \        :OR:(($dom):SHL:5):OR:($ucb):OR:($type))    MEXITENDIFIF ($type=PAGE)    DCD ((($addr):AND:&amp;FFFFFC00):OR:(($dom):SHL:5) \        :OR:(($ucb):AND:U_BIT):OR:$type)ELSE    DCD 0 ; Invalid Level 1 Page Table EntryENDIFMEND</CODE></PRE>Note that a backslash breaks a logical line of assembly language across two physical lines.  However, there must be no character after the backslash on the line.<P><H3>Explanation</H3>The macro definition is enclosed between MACRO and MEND. The first line of the definition gives the macro's name and lists its parameters.<P>The body of the macro illustrates the use of IF ... ENDIF and IF ... ELSE ... ENDIF to assemble different code conditional on a value known at assembly-time. In this example, the controlling expressions of the IFs involve a macro parameter ($type) which gets its value when the macro is called.<P>This macro definition also shows how the MEXIT directive can be used to exit from processing a macro before the MEND directive is reached. You can think of MEXIT as being like a <I>return</I> statement in a C function. <P><H2>Assembling the page tables in plain binary format</H2>This section tells you how to create a file containing a plain binary image of the page tables. In other words, a file containing just the bytes you would need to load into memory <I>and nothing else</I> by way of symbolic information, file content descriptors, load addresses, etc.<P>You create a plain binary image in two steps: first you create a relocatable object file from your source file; then you use <I>armlink</I> to make a plain binary version of the relocatable object.<P><H3>Method</H3>Set your current directory to that containing the <I>pagetab.s</I> program then assemble <I>pagetab.s</I> and link <I>pagetab.o</I> as follows:<P><CODE><PRE>armasm pagetab.s -o pagetab.o -liarmlink -bin -o pagetab pagetab.o</CODE></PRE><H3>Explanation</H3>As in earlier examples, the -li option tells <I>armasm</I> to assemble code for a little-endian memory.  This need not be specified if the tools have been <I>configured</I> for little-endian operation.<P>The -bin option tells <I>armlink</I> to make a plain binary output file containing nothing but the bytes you described in your source program.<P>Because pagetab contains no position-dependent data, you do not need to tell <I>armlink</I> where to base its output.  If there had been position-dependent data or code, you would have had to use the -base<I> address</I> option to tell <I>armlink</I> where to base its output and, of course, you would only be able to use the output at that memory address.<P><H2>Related topics</H2><UL><LI><A HREF="./1acbe.html#XREF21678">Loading constants into registers</A>.</UL>
