<TITLE>Loading a word from an unknown alignment</TITLE><H1>Loading a word from an unknown alignment</H1><HR><H2>About this recipe</H2>In this recipe a code sequence which loads a word from memory at any byte alignment is described.  Although loading 32-bit data from non word aligned addresses should be avoided whenever possible, it may sometimes be necessary.<P><H2>The details</H2>The ARM Load and Store (single and multiple) instructions are designed to load word aligned data.  Unless there is a very good reason it is best to avoid having to load or store word-sized data to or from non word aligned addresses, as neither the Load or Store instruction can do this unaided.<P>To deal with misaligned word fetches two words must be read and the required data extracted from these two words.  The code below performs this operation for a little endian ARM, making good use of the barrel shifter in the process.<P><CODE><PRE>; enter with address in R0; R2 and R3 are used as temporary registers; the word is loaded into R1;</CODE></PRE><CODE><PRE>BIC    R2, R0, #3                         ; Get word aligned addressLDMIA  R2, {R1, R3}                       ; Get 64 bits containing dataAND    R2, R0, #3                         ; Get offset in bytesMOVS   R2, R2, LSL #3                     ; Get offset in bitsMOVNE  R1, R1, LSR R2                     ; Extract data from bottom 32 bitsRSBNE  R2, R2, #32                        ; Get 32 - offset in bitsORRNE  R1, R1, R3, LSL R2                 ; Extract data from top 32 bits                                          ; and combine with the other data</CODE></PRE>This code can easily be modified for use on a big endian ARM - the LSR R2 and LSL R2 just have to be swapped over.<P>For details of what the Load and Store instructions do if used with non word aligned addresses refer to the appropriate datasheet.
