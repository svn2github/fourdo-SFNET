<TITLE>Overview of key features</TITLE><H1>Overview of key features</H1><HR>The ARM instruction set has the following key features, some of which are common to many other processors, and some of which are not:<P><UL><LI>Load/Store architecture (only load and store instructions access memory).<P><LI>32 bit instructions, 32/8 bit data words/bytes.<P><LI>32 bit addresses (26 bit on earlier ARMs).<P><LI>15 general purpose 32 bit registers, program counter and program status register - a subset of these are banked, to give rapid context switching for interrupt and supervisor modes. (See the appropriate ARM Data Sheet for details of particular processors).<P><LI>Flexible store multiple and load multiple instructions allow any set of registers from a single bank to be transferred to/from memory by a single instruction.<P><LI>There is no single instruction to move an immediate 32 bit value to a register (in general, a literal value has to be loaded from memory).  However, a large set of common 32-bit values <I>can</I> be generated in a single instruction.<P><LI>All instructions are executed conditionally on the state of the current program status register.  Only data processing operations with the S bit set change the state of the current program status register.<P><LI>The second argument to all data-processing and single data-transfer operations can be shifted in quite a general way before the operation is performed. This supports, but is not limited to, scaled addressing, multiplication by a small constant, and construction of constants, within a single instruction.<P><LI>Co-processor instructions support a general way to extend the ARM's architecture in a customer-specific manner.</UL>In addition, the ARM processor has:<P><UL><LI>Support for Big- or Little-Endian memory.<P><LI>A powerful barrel shifter to support ARM's within-instruction shifts.</UL>The recipes in this chapter discuss some of these features in greater detail.<P>
