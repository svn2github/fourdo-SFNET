<TITLE>ARM Cookbook</TITLE><H1><IMG SRC="Figures/ARMCookbook.gif">ARM Cookbook</H1><HR>This document covers a broad spectrum of topics; from introductory illustrations through to complex examples. The material has not been grouped or ordered by complexity, but by theme. Where possible, we have given real recipes, supported by on-line code explained and available for you to adapt to your particular needs. <P>To get the most out of the recipes, use this manual in conjunction with the on-line examples, as well as the rest of the toolkit documentation. The user is sometimes referred to other parts of the documentation for more information.<P>It is also useful to have a copy of the ARM Datasheet for whatever device is being used, as these manuals do not cover device specific details.<P><H1>Audience</H1>This manual is aimed at competent programmers who want to find out rapidly how to exploit the ARM instruction set and make use of the ARM Software Development Toolkit (the toolkit). <P><H1>How this document is organized</H1>This document provides information about four main areas of interest:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="./acb1frst.html#XREF13490">ARM Instruction Set and Processor Features</A>, discusses features of the ARM instruction set.<P><LI><A HREF="./acb2frst.html#XREF32584">Exploring ARM Assembly Language</A>, explores the ARM Assembly Language by providing several examples.<P><LI><A HREF="./acb3frst.html#XREF41444">Interfacing Assembly Language and C</A>, provides examples and recipes for interfacing C and ARM Assembly Language.<P><LI><A HREF="./acb4frst.html#XREF37173">Programming in C</A>, provides example of programming in C with the ARM Software Development Toolkit.</UL><H1>Examples used in this document</H1>The examples in this document are meant for illustration only. The code for the examples is not included with the 3DO (tm)  software. <P>
