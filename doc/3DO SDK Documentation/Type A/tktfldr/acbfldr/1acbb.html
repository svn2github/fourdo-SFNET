<TITLE>Making the most of conditional execution</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF38287">Making the most of conditional execution</LINK></H1><HR><H2>About this recipe</H2>In this recipe you learn how conditional execution can eliminate branch instructions, producing smaller and faster code. Euclid's Greatest Common Divisor algorithm is used for illustrative purposes. Specifically, you will learn how to use:<P><UL><LI>conditional execution;<LI>the 'S' bit in ARM data processing instructions.</UL><H2>The ARM's ALU status flags</H2>The ARM's Program Status Register contains, among other flags, copies of the ALU status flags:<P><PRE>---------------------------------------------------------N     |Negative result from ALU flag                     ---------------------------------------------------------Z     |Zero result from ALU flag                         ---------------------------------------------------------C     |ALU operation Carried out                         ---------------------------------------------------------V     |ALU operation oVerflowed                          ---------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><H2>Execution conditions</H2>Every ARM instruction has a 4 bit field which encodes the conditions under which it will be executed.  These conditions refer to the state of the ALU N, Z, C and V flags as follows:<P><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------EQ     |Z set (equal)                                   --------------------------------------------------------NE     |Z clear (not equal)                             --------------------------------------------------------CS/HS  |C set (unsigned &gt;=)                             --------------------------------------------------------CC/LO  |C clear (unsigned &lt;)                            --------------------------------------------------------MI     |N set (negative)                                --------------------------------------------------------PL     |N clear (positive or zero)                      --------------------------------------------------------VS     |V set (overflow)                                --------------------------------------------------------VC     |V clear (no overflow)                           --------------------------------------------------------HI     |C set and Z clear (unsigned &gt;)                  --------------------------------------------------------LS     |C clear and Z set (unsigned &lt;=)                 --------------------------------------------------------GE     |N and V the same (signed &gt;=)                    --------------------------------------------------------LT     |N and V differ (signed &lt;)                       --------------------------------------------------------GT     |Z clear, N and V the same (signed &gt;)            --------------------------------------------------------LE     |Z set, N and V differ (signed &lt;=)               --------------------------------------------------------AL     |Always execute (the default if none is                 |specified)                                      --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><H2>Setting the ALU flags in the PSR</H2>Data processing instructions change the state of the ALU's N,Z,C and V status outputs but these are latched in the PSR'S ALU flags only if a special bit (the 'S' bit) is set in the instruction.<P><H2>Illustration</H2>The following code fragment is extracted from <B>gcd.c</B>, which can be found in the <B>examples</B> directory.<P><CODE><PRE>while (a != b){ if (a &gt; b) a -= b;  else       b -= a;}</CODE></PRE>Without conditional execution this could be naively coded as:<P><CODE><PRE>gcd CMP    a1, a2    BEQ    end    BLT    lessthan    SUB    a1, a1, a2    B      gcdlessthan    SUB    a2, a2, a1    B      gcdend </CODE></PRE>Conditional execution and selective setting of the PSR'S ALU flags allows it to be coded much more compactly as follows (this version can be found in the <B>examples</B> directory as <B>gcd.s</B>).<P><CODE><PRE>gcd CMP    a1, a2    SUBGT  a1, a1, a2    SUBLT  a2, a2, a1    BNE    gcd</CODE></PRE>Two tricks are illustrated:<P><UL><LI>The CMP instruction (implicitly) has the 'S' bit set, so the result of the comparison sets the PSR ALU status flags.  However, the following  two subtractions do not have the 'S' bit set, so they do not affect the PSR ALU status flags which remain in the state set by the earlier CMP instruction when the BNE instruction is executed.  The test (a != b) has been combined with the branch back to the top of the loop, giving shorter code, and in many instances code which runs more quickly.<P><LI>The two subtractions are executed only if the condition specified is met, so two branches around these instructions can be avoided.  In addition to the obvious benefit of smaller code, any pipeline refill caused by the branches will also have been avoided.</UL><H2>Running the C example</H2>You can run the C <B>gcd</B> routine shown above under <B>armsd</B>.  To do this first set your current directory to the <B>examples</B> directory.<P>Compile, link and run the C version of the <B>gcd</B> routine by using the following commands:<P><CODE><PRE>armcc -c gcd.c -li -apcs 3/32bitarmcc -c gcdtest.c -li -apcs 3/32bitarmlink -o gcdtest gcd.o gcdtest.o <B>somewhere</B>/armlib.321armsd -li gcdtest</CODE></PRE>where <B>somewhere</B> is the directory in which <B>armlib.32l</B> can be found.<P><H3>Explanation</H3>The two <B>armcc</B> commands compile the gcd function and the test harness, creating relocatable object files <B>gcd.o</B> and <B>gcdtest.o</B>.  The -li flag tells <B>armcc</B> to compile for a little-endian memory. The -apcs 3/32bit option tells <B>armcc</B> to use a 32 bit version of the ARM Procedure Call Standard.  You can omit these options if your <B>armcc</B> has been configured for this default.<P>The <B>armlink</B> command links your relocatable objects with the ARM C library to create a runnable program (here called <B>gcdtest</B>).<P>The <B>armsd</B> command invokes the debugger, with <B>gcdtest</B> as the program to be run.  Again -li specifies that little-endian memory is required (as with <B>armasm</B> above).<P><H2>Running the assembler example</H2>You can run the <B>gcd</B> routine shown above under <B>armsd</B>.  To do this first set your current directory to the <B>examples</B> directory.<P>You can assemble, link and run the assembler <B>gcd</B> routine by using the following commands:<P><CODE><PRE>armasm gcd.s -o gcd.o -liarmcc -c gcdtest.c -li -3/32bitarmlink -o gcdtest gcd.o gcdtest.o <B>somewhere</B>/armlib.32larmsd -li gcdtest</CODE></PRE>where <B>somewhere</B> is the directory in which <B>armlib.32l</B> can be found.<P><H3>Explanation</H3>The <B>armasm</B> command assembles the <B>gcd</B> function, creating the relocatable object file <B>gcd.o</B>.  The -li flag tells <B>armasm</B> to assemble for a little-endian memory.  The -apcs 3/32bit option tells <B>armcc</B> to use a 32 bit version of the ARM Procedure Call Standard.  You can omit these options if your <B>armasm</B> has been configured for this default.<P>The <B>armcc</B> command compiles the test harness.  The -c flag tells <B>armcc</B> not to link its output with the C library; the -li flag tells <B>armcc</B> to compile for a little-endian memory (as with <B>armasm</B>).<P>The <B>armlink</B> command links your relocatable objects with the ARM C library to create a runnable program (here called <B>gcdtest</B>).<P>The <B>armsd</B> command invokes the debugger, with <B>gcdtest</B> as the program to be run.  Again -li specifies that little-endian memory is required (as with <B>armasm</B> above).<P><H2>Related topics</H2><UL><LI>There are many examples of code which makes good use of the ARM's condition codes and 'S' bit in recipes in <A HREF="./acb2frst.html#XREF32584">Exploring ARM Assembly Language</A>.</UL>
