<TITLE>Editing cel effects</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF20020">Editing cel effects</LINK></H1><HR>The Effects editor allows you to modify the PIXC settings of a cel. Modifying PIXC settings adjusts special effects in a cel, such as translucency. The changes you make in the Effects editor are shown immediately on the Workbench and on the television monitor. For background information on P-Mode and PIXC settings, see <A HREF="../ginfldr/0ginfrst.html#XREF26655">Introduction to 3DO Graphics</A>. <P>This section shows you how to edit a cel's display characteristics using the Effects editor. It provides an example for settings that achieve 50 percent translucency for a cel. <P>After the walk-through instructions, examples of settings to achieve 25 percent and 75 percent translucency for a cel are also given.<P>To change the effects of a cel to 50 percent translucency, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Launch 3DO PostPro.<P><LI>From the File menu, select Open.
