It comes back with an error stating that it is out of memory and cannot swap to a shell (two errors in total).<P>A:  Try increasing MPW's memory to something really big (30 MB). If MakeCel still doesn't work, it's probably not really a memory problem. <P><DL><DD><UL><LI>If the large amount of RAM works, start scaling it back until the problem reappears. Then bump it back up again. <P><LI>If that doesn't work, there may be a bug in MakeCel. Try running it with a different image, something small and simple.</UL><BR></DL><A NAME="XREF36526"><H2>Documentation for PPM tools</A></H2>Q:  Where can I find documentation for the PPM tools?<P>A:  Documentation for the public domain PPM tools are provided on-line in the same folder as the tool itself.
