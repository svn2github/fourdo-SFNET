Images are usually used as the background. In contrast to cels, images can't be moved or scaled, and can't use special effects. For more information, see <A HREF="./1ginb.html#XREF28674">What are images and cels?</A> and <A HREF="./1ginc.html#XREF21687">Working with images</A>.<P><LI>3DO cels can start out at any size, since the 3DO hardware can scale cels. Cels can have a resolution between 1 bit per pixel and 16 bits per pixel. You can create irregularly shaped cels, that is, cels that aren't rectangular but have the shape of the object they represent, by making parts of the cel transparent. A variety of effects are available, including:</UL><DL><DD><UL><LI>Translucency for ghost effects or to create stained glass windows.<P><LI>Enhanced luminance per color to enhance a flashing red light or per region to create a radiant creature.<P><LI>Reduced luminance to create a shadow or smoke effects.</UL><BR></DL><UL><LI>For more information, see <A HREF="./1ginb.html#XREF37168">What is a 3DO cel?</A> and <A HREF="./1ginc.html#XREF26236">Working with cels</A>.</UL><UL><LI><B>3DO animations</B> (ANIMs) consist of several 3DO cels. If you understand how to use cels, you also understand how to prepare animations. <P><LI><B>Fonts</B> can be created with a special tool, the 3DO FontWriter. You can generate anti-aliased fonts from any font loaded on your Macintosh. While conversion is automatic, you can edit individual fonts if needed. For more information, see the <A HREF="../fowfldr/01FOW.html">3DO FontWriter User's Guide</A>. <P><LI><B>Video</B> is currently submitted in a software-compressed form. Synchronized video and audio are rendered by a special programmer tool, the 3DO DataStreamer. Hardware-compressed video will be available in the near future for 3DO Stations and 3DO players that have a special MPEG card.
