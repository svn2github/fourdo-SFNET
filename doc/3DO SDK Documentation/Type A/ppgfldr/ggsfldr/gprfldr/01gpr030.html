It requires that the ccb_Width and ccb_Height fields of the CCB are correct when the routine is called, and that the routine will replace the current values of the ccb_Width and ccb_Height fields. If the ccb_Width and ccb_Height of the cel are both powers of 2, then they are replaced by the log(base 2) of their respective values. If one or both fields are not a power of 2, the ccb_Width is replaced by (-0x10000/ccb_Width) and ccb_Height is replaced by (0x10000/ccb_Height). <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>ccb<DD>Pointer to the CCB structure to be modified. </DL><H3>Implementation</H3>Convenience call implemented in graphics.lib V21. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>graphics.h, graphics.lib<P><H3>Caveats</H3>The FastMapCel calls are not compatible with <CODE>MapCel()</CODE>, and cannot be called interchangeably. <P>Since this call modifies the ccb_Width and ccb_Height fields of the CCB, it cannot be called multiple times for the same CCB. <P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01gpr028.html#XREF34286"><CODE>FastMapCel</A>(), <A HREF="./01gpr029.html#XREF30188">FastMapCelf16</A>(), <A HREF="./01gpr045.html#XREF30941">MapCel</A>() </CODE><P></CODE>
