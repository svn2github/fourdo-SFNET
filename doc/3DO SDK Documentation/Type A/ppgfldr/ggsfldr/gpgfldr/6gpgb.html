How much data is traveling across the bus (at 50 MB/s) is by far the most critical factor affecting cel rendering speed. <P>A new feature called super clipping helps speed things up when portions of a cel extend beyond the boundaries of the screen. <P><B>Q:</B> I am drawing a cel in a variety of shapes and sizes. Are there any guidelines to determine the optimum size (number of pixels) for the original image?<P><B>A:</B> Here are two hints for drawing cels quickly: <P><UL><LI>Packed cels with transparency render faster than unpacked cels. <LI>Small cels render faster than big ones, even when scaled. </UL><I>See also:</I> <A HREF="#XREF22819">Huge Cels Draw Slowly</A>.<P><A NAME="XREF14083"><H2>CPU and DMA</A></H2><B>Q:</B> The 3DO system uses the DMA when displaying cels. Can the CPU do other work during that time? <P><B>A:</B> When the cel engine is running, the CPU can't operate. When the cel engine finishes, the CPU can operate again.<P>Remember, however, that the cel engine renders graphics much faster than the CPU.<P>The cel engine pauses for CPU interrupts so that time critical events to maintain the system still function.<P><A NAME="XREF12708"><H2>When Cel-Display Calls Return</A></H2><B>Q:</B> I need to determine when a display process starts and be notified when it's finished. <P><B>A:</B> A <CODE>DisplayScreen()</CODE> call returns immediately. The specified screen is displayed   after the next vertical blank. <P>A <CODE>DrawCels()</CODE> call does not return until the cels have been rendered. <P><A NAME="XREF13117"><H2> Displaying Text as a Cel</A></H2><B>Q:</B> How do I render text into a cel so that I can take advantage of the cel engine's features. None of the text calls takes or returns a CCB.<P><B>A:</B> Currently text routines can only render into a bitmap, so you need to have the cel engine extract the text from an off-screen bitmap.<P>Make sure the CCB for the extracting cel correctly represents the data in the off-screen bitmap. Pay special attention to the CCB preamble words.<P><A NAME="XREF26516"><H2>Using Relative Addressing with Cels</A></H2>Below is a code snippet. The trick is to use the call <CODE>MakeCCBRelative</CODE>. <P><CODE><PRE>CCB* testCelP;CCB* nextCelP;    // assign the relative offset to the next celtestCelP-&gt;ccb_NextPtr = (CCB*)MakeCCBRelative(&amp;testCelP-&gt;ccb_NextPtr, nextCelP);    // be sure to clear this bit!ClearFlag(testCelP-&gt;ccb_Flags, CCB_NPABS);The macros MakeCCBRelative and ClearFlag are defined in graphics.h.</CODE></PRE>
