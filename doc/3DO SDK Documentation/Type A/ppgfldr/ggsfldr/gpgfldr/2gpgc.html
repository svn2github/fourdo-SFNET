<TITLE>The Background Pixel Detector</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF13159">The Background Pixel Detector</LINK></H1><HR>The first component of the display generator is the background pixel detector, which reads the incoming 15-bit color value to see if it is set to zero (R=0, G=0, and B=0). If it is, the detector sets the background pixel flag so the incoming pixel is treated as a background pixel. This flag notifies the CLUT sets and SlipStream, the two components that can act on background pixels.<P><A NAME="XREF12601"></A>
