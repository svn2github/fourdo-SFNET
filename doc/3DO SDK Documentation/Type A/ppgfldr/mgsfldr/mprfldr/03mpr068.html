If it is recorded at 22 kHz, the pitch can go two octaves up.  A rate of 0x8000 corresponds to one data sample per DAC sample frame.  0xFFFF is the highest possible rate. <P><H3>Knobs</H3>Frequency  -  units are fixed point phase increment.  $8000 equals the normal sample rate, with 1 sample per frame.  Thus, you can go from zero to one octave above the original. <P>Amplitude - 0  =&gt;  $7FFF <P><H3>Inputs</H3>None <P><H3>Outputs</H3>Output<P><H3>Input FIFOs</H3>InFIFO <P><H3>Output FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Resources</H3>Ticks = 38 <P>N memory = 50 words <P><P>
