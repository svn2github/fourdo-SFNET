An SPSound cannot be removed from its owning SPPlayer while it is being read from while the player is running. This function is necessary for a client to know when it is safe to remove an SPSound. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>sound<DD>Pointer to SPSound to test. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>TRUE if sound is currently being read by player; FALSE otherwise. <P><H3>Caveats</H3>Returns FALSE too early for Sample Item class SPSounds. Since the spooler is given a pointer to the Sample Item's memory directly, rather than copying it into the spooler buffers, it must not return FALSE until a Sample Item SPSound has actually finished playing, not finished being read. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in music.lib V24. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>soundplayer.h, music.lib<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./02mpr084.html#XREF24744"><CODE>spRemoveSound</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr093.html#XREF20856">spStop</A>() </CODE><P></CODE>
