Barring the result of a marker or default decision function, when the playback encounters the 'from' marker, the playback will skip to the 'to' marker seamlessly. <P>Markers can have one of 3 static actions: continue, branch, or stop. This action can be changed at any time, including while the player is playing. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>fromSound<DD>Pointer to SPSound containing marker to branch from. </DL><DL><DT>fromMarkerName<DD>Name of marker in fromSound to branch from. All markers except markers at the beginning of sounds are considered valid "from" markers. </DL><DL><DT>toSound<DD>Pointer to SPSound containing marker to branch to. </DL><DL><DT>toMarkerName<DD>Name of marker to branch to in toSound. All markers except markers at the end of sounds are considered valid "to" markers. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Non-negative value on success; negative error code on failure. <P><H3>Notes</H3>Both SPSounds must belong to the same SPPlayer. <P>Good sounding results require good placement of markers in the sounds. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in music.lib V24. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>soundplayer.h, music.lib<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./02mpr094.html#XREF41521"><CODE>spStopAtMarker</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr067.html#XREF24196">spContinueAtMarker</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr089.html#XREF13040">spSetMarkerDecisionFunction</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr088.html#XREF33640">spSetDefaultDecisionFunction</A>() </CODE><P></CODE>
