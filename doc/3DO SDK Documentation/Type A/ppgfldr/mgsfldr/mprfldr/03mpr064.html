The result is clipped to -$8000 and +$7FFF, the range of signed values.  This limits its usefulness with sample players that use unsigned frequency between 0 and $FFFF.<P><H3>Notes</H3>Multiplying 0x8000 by 0x8000 causes an overflow yielding a result of 0x8000.  This means that (-1) x (-1) = (-1).  Thus, if you multiply a signal by 0x8000, it will pop if the signal also contains 0x8000.<P><H3>Knobs</H3>InputA <P>InputB <P>InputC <P><H3>Inputs</H3>None <P><H3>Outputs</H3>Output<P><H3>Input FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Output FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Resources</H3>Ticks = 10 <P>N memory = 7 words <P>
