Envelopes are described by an array of pairs of time and data. It can be used to specify a loop for sustained sound. <P>Data typically ranges from -32,768 to 32,767 or 0 to 65,535, and must be sign-extended to 32 bits. Loops are specified as point indices. For more information, read the description of envelopes in the Music Programmer's Guide. <P>When you are finished with the envelope, you should call <CODE>DeleteEnvelope()</CODE> to delete it and deallocate its resources. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>Points<DD>An array of DataTimePair values giving delta time in milliseconds accompanied by data values. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_ADDRESS tag argument described in SetAudioItemInfo(). The Points array is not copied: it must remain valid for the life of the Envelope Item or until it is replaced with another array of Points by a call to <CODE>SetAudioItemInfo()</CODE>. </DL><DL><DT>NumPoints<DD>The number of points in the array. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_FRAMES tag argument. </DL><DL><DT>SustainBegin<DD>The beginning index of the loop. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_SUSTAINBEGIN tag argument. Set to - 1 for no sustain loop.</DL><DL><DT>SustainEnd<DD>The ending index of the loop. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_SUSTAINEND tag argument. Set to -1 for no sustain loop. Otherwise must be &gt;= SustainBegin. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>The function returns the item number of the envelope (a positive value) or an error code (a negative value) if an error occurs. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Folio call implemented in Audio folio V20. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>audio.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01mpr028.html#XREF17495"><CODE>DeleteEnvelope</A>(), <A HREF="./01mpr006.html#XREF15951">AttachEnvelope</A>()</CODE><P></CODE>
