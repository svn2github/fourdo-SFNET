Run the SoundHack program to compress a sound sample from 16 bits to 4 bits (Intel/DVI format).  This instrument uses the decodeadpcm.dsp library routine which must be loaded as an instrument prior to using this instrument.  This instrument plays a sample that was recorded at 22050 Hertz, playing it back at 44100 Hertz with interpolated values between samples to keep the sampled sound's original pitch and duration. <P><H3>Knobs</H3>Amplitude  - 0  =&gt;  $7FFF <P><H3>Inputs</H3>None <P><H3>Outputs</H3>Output<P><H3>Input FIFOs</H3>InFIFO <P><H3>Output FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Resources</H3>Ticks=103 <P>N memory = 71 words <P>
