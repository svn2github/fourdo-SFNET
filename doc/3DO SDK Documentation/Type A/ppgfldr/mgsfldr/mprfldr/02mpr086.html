You must call it after waiting for SPPlayer's signals before calling any other sound player function for this SPPlayer (with the exception of <CODE>spDeletePlayer()</CODE>, which can tolerate the spooler being out of sync with the task's signals). <P>This function can set or clear the SP_STATUS_F_BUFFER_ACTIVE flag, depending on buffer usage. It clears SP_STATUS_F_READING when there's no more sound data to read. This function may be called under any player state including when SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING is not set without any ill effects. <P>This function must be called exactly once for each <CODE>WaitSignal()</CODE> on an SPPlayer's signals. It will almost certainly have dangerous results if fed incorrect signals (signals other than from the most recent <CODE>WaitSignal()</CODE>, or signals that it has already processed). <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>player<DD>Pointer to SPPlayer to service. </DL><DL><DT>signals<DD>Signals last received to process. Ignores any signals that do not belong to this SPPlayer. Does nothing if none of the SPPlayer's signals are set. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Non-negative player status flags (SP_STATUS_F_) on success; negative error code on failure. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in music.lib V24. <P><H3>Examples</H3><CODE><PRE>// error checking omitted for brevity{    const int32 playersigs = spGetPlayerSignalMask (player);        // service player until it's done    while (spGetPlayerStatus(player) &amp; SP_STATUS_F_BUFFER_ACTIVE) {        const int32 sigs = WaitSignal (playersigs |                                       othersignals1 |                                       othersignals2);            // service player before servicing other            // things that might affect the player        spService (player, playersigs);            // service other things        if (sigs &amp; othersignals1) {        }        if (sigs &amp; othersignals2) {        }    }}</CODE></PRE><H3>Associated Files</H3>soundplayer.h, music.lib<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./02mpr076.html#XREF26745"><CODE>spGetPlayerSignalMask</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr077.html#XREF27522">spGetPlayerStatus</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr092.html#XREF25186">spStartReading</A>(), <A HREF="./02mpr091.html#XREF15941">spStartPlaying</A>() </CODE><P></CODE>
