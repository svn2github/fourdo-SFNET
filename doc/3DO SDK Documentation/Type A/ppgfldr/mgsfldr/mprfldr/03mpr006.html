This is a 2:1 compression.  The compression is done by SquashSnd or SoundHack.   This instrument plays a sample that was recorded at 22,050 hertz, playing it back at 44,100 hertz with interpolated values between samples to keep the sampled sound's original pitch and duration. <P><H3>Knobs</H3>Amplitude - 0  =&gt;  $7FFF <P><H3>Inputs</H3>None <P><H3>Outputs</H3>Output<P><H3>Input FIFOs</H3>InFIFO <P><H3>Output FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Resources</H3>Ticks = 64 <P>N memory = 62 words <P><H3>Caveats</H3>Note that dcsqxdvarmono.dsp is more efficient.<P>
