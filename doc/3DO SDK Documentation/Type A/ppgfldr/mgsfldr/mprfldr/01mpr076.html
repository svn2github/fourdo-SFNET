<Title>TraceAudio</Title><A NAME="XREF19994"><H1>TraceAudio </A></H1><A NAME="XREF30159"> </A>Turns specific audio diagnostics on or off (OBSOLETE)<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>uint32 TraceAudio (uint32 traceMask)</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3>This function is obsolete.<P>Development versions of the Audio folio have diagnostic information available which can be turned on or off with this function. To help 3DO Technical Support diagnose a bug, you may be asked to turn on certain TRACE _ flags and send the result for interpretation. <P>This function has no effect in production versions of the Audio folio. <P>Note that this is a system-wide setting. It affects all clients of the Audio folio, not just the task that calls <CODE>TraceAudio()</CODE>. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>traceMask<DD>Set of flags indicating which information should be on. A set flag turns on the corresponding trace feature, a cleared flag turns off the corresponding trace feature. 0 turns off all tracing. See Flags section for complete description of each trace flag. </DL><H3>Flags</H3><DL><DT>TRACE_ATTACHMENT<DD>Trace an attachment. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_DSP<DD>Trace DSP specific calls such as <CODE>AllocAmplitude()</CODE>. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_ENVELOPE<DD>Trace an envelope. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_INT<DD>Trace internal information. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_ITEM<DD>Trace item creation and deletion. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_KNOB<DD>Trace a knob. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_NOTE<DD>Trace note playing. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_OFX<DD>Trace parsing of DSP instrument files, DSP resource allocation, and so on. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_SAMPLE<DD>Trace AIFF sample loading, and so on. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_TIMER<DD>Trace a timer. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_TOP<DD>Trace the parameters passed to, and returned from, most Audio folio calls. </DL><DL><DT>TRACE_TUNING<DD>Trace a tuning. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>The function returns the previous trace mask setting. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>SWI implemented in Audio folio V20. <P><H3>Examples</H3><CODE><PRE>// Turn on a few interesting thingsTraceAudio (TRACE_TOP | TRACE_INT | TRACE_KNOB);// Turn off all tracingTraceAudio (0);</CODE></PRE><H3>Caveats</H3>Given that this is a system-wide setting that any task can set at any time, it really isn't possible to use the return value of this function to create a stack of previous settings. As soon as more than one task starts setting <CODE>TraceAudio()</CODE>, the stack would be invalid. <P>As of V24, this function has no longer has any effect.  The messages were removed to reduce code size. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>audio.h<P>
