It is used internally when it is called by other adpcm routines to implement the decompression of 4-bit samples.  Load this instrument using <CODE>LoadInstrument()</CODE> before loading other adpcm instruments. <P>Sound samples are compressed from 16-bit samples to 4-bit samples using the SoundHack program.   These 4- bit samples are in the standard Intel/DVI format.  This library routine decompresses the 4-bit samples so that they can be played by other adpcm instruments. <P><H3>Knobs</H3>None <P><H3>Inputs</H3>None <P><H3>Outputs</H3>In accumulator <P><H3>Input FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Output FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Resource</H3>Ticks = 0 <P>N memory = 51 words <P>
