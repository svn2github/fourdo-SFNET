This instrument is identical to sampler.dsp, except that you should use varmono16.dsp if you are short on ticks. <P>This instrument is limited to a pitch one octave above base pitch, if recorded at 44.1 kHz.  If it is recorded at 22 kHz, the pitch can go two octaves up.  A rate of 0x8000 corresponds to one data sample per DAC sample frame.  0xFFFF is the highest possible rate. <P><H3>Knobs</H3>Frequency  -  units are fixed point phase increment.  $8000 equals the normal sample rate, with 1 sample per frame.  Thus, you can go from zero to one octave above the original. <P>Amplitude - 0  =&gt;  $7FFF <P><H3>Inputs</H3>None <P><H3>Outputs</H3>Output<P><H3>Input FIFOs</H3>InFIFO <P><H3>Output FIFOs</H3>None <P><H3>Resources</H3>Ticks = 25 <P>N memory = 26 words <P>
