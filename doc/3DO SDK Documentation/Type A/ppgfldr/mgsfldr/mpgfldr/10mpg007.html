The microsecond or the vertical blanking timer can also be used but are not synchronous with the audio clock. <P><H2>SMPTE</H2><B>Q:  </B> Can we link an effect to SMPTE?<P><B>A:</B>  SMPTE decoding hardware for tape is not available. <P><H2>Multi-thread Timers</H2><B>Q: </B>  I have some success with GetAudioTime using ticks. I was not sure if multiple threads could use the timer at the same time?<P><B>A: </B>  Yes they can. The restriction is that cue items must be allocated by the thread that uses them. You may also want to own the audio timer, <CODE>OwnAudioTimer()</CODE>, if you are worried about some other thread changing the audio timer rate on you.<P><P>
