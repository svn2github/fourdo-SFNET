<TITLE>How Do I Play an Audio Sample?</TITLE><H1>How Do I Play an Audio Sample?</H1><HR>To play an audio sample, you need to do the following:<P><OL><LI>Call <CODE>LoadSample()</CODE> to load an AIFF sample into memory. <p>You can also load samples of other formats into memory yourself and turn them into 3DO sample items by calling <CODE>CreateSample()</CODE>.<p><LI>Call <CODE>LoadInstrument()</CODE> to <CODE>l</CODE>oad a DSP instrument that can play that sample. You can determine the appropriate instrument name by looking in the table at the beginning of <A HREF="../mprfldr/03mpr.html#XREF41103">Instrument Templates</A>, in the <I>3DO Music and Audio Programmer's Reference</I> or by calling <CODE>SelectSamplePlayer()</CODE>.<p><LI>Call <CODE>AttachSample()</CODE> to attach the sample to the instrument. <p>You can use the same sample on multiple instruments, or  you can use multiple samples on one instrument.<p><LI>Call <CODE>StartInstrument()</CODE> to start playing the sample. <p>The instrument starts whatever sample is attached to it. <p><LI>Call <CODE>ReleaseInstrument()</CODE> to stop a sample that is looping, </OL><H3>For More Information</H3>For more information on the calls in this section, see <A HREF="../mprfldr/01mpr.html#XREF16932">Audio Folio Calls</A>, in the <I>3DO Music and Audio Programmer's Reference</I>.<P>See <A HREF="./03mpg.html#XREF22719">Preparing Instruments</A>, and  <A HREF="./04mpg.html#XREF33207">Playing Instruments</A>, for complete programming details. <P>For an example of playing a sound,  see the example program <I>playsample.c</I>.<P>
