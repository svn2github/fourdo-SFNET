<TITLE>How Do I Manage Multiple Sound Effects?</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF38933">How Do I Manage Multiple Sound Effects?</LINK></H1><HR>There are several ways to manage multiple sound effects, depending on the nature of the sound effects.<P>If you have a few Samples and they can be played by instruments that fit in the DSP at the same time, you can do the following: <P><OL><LI>Load all the instruments and samples.<LI>Attach the samples.<LI>Connect all the instruments to a mixer. <LI>Call <CODE>StartInstrument()</CODE> to trigger the sound effect for the appropriate instrument.</OL>If the instruments do not all fit in the DSP at the same time, but the Samples are all of the same format,  you can do the following:<P><OL><LI>Load several instruments and connect them to a mixer as above. <p><LI>Load all of the samples.<p><LI>Attach all of the samples to each instrument. <p><LI>Keep track of the attachments returned by <CODE>AttachSample()</CODE> in arrays. <p><LI>Set the attachment flags to AF_ATTF_NOAUTOSTART<CODE>|</CODE>AF_ATTF_FATLADYSINGS using <CODE>SetAudioItemInfo()</CODE> so that you can start the instrument without triggering any particular sample. <p><LI>Start each of the instruments playing. <p><LI>Call <CODE>StartAttachment()</CODE> when you want to trigger a sample on a particular  instrument for the appropriate attachment.<p><LI>Call <CODE>GetAudioItemInfo()</CODE> with AF_TAG_STATUS to determine which instrument is stopped when you want to trigger the next attachment. See <A HREF="./01mpg004.html#XREF20901">How Do I Play a Long Sound File?</A> for more details.</OL>If you have multiple kinds of instruments, you need a more sophisticated dynamic voice allocation scheme. You can use the voice allocator that is part of the score playing utility in the Music library.
