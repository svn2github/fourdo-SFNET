This is equivalent to the function of a graphic equalizer on a boom box. I am specifically interested in increasing the amplitude in the "bass" range.<P><B>A: </B>  Yes. You can use the <CODE>svfilter.dsp</CODE>. In addition to the Output, which is a lowpass filter, it also has BandPass and HighPass outputs. You can use the BandPass output or the LowPass, optionally mixed with original signal, to boost bass response.<P>Another approach is to use the EQ or filter effects in Sound Designer to boost the bass in the sample before you play it.<P><P>
