You can use the same sample on multiple instruments, or  you can use multiple samples on one instrument. What you really need to know is when a specific attachment has finished. There are two ways to do this:  <P><UL><LI>The first is to call <CODE>MonitorAttachment()</CODE> to request a signal when the sample or envelope has finished. This method can be used with <CODE>WaitSignal()</CODE> which lets a task sleep until the attachment is finished. <p><LI>The second way is to set the AF_ATTF_FATLADYSINGS flag in the attachment. When the attachment finishes, it stops the associated instrument. You can then poll the instrument by calling <CODE>GetAudioItemInfo()</CODE> with AF_TAG_STATUS.</UL>Be careful when you are polling for an instrument to finish. Never loop continuously while polling. This is called <I>busy waiting</I>. Busy waiting takes up CPU cycles and can cause a drop in performance or a deadlock.<P><H3>For More Information</H3>See <A HREF="./03mpg.html#XREF22719">Preparing Instruments</A>, for complete programming details.<P>See <A HREF="../mprfldr/01mpr.html#XREF16932">Audio Folio Calls</A>, in the <I>3DO Music and Audio Programmer's Reference</I> for information on these calls.<P>See the example files <I>ta_attach.c</I> and <I>sample_envelope.c</I> for examples of <CODE>MonitorAttachment()</CODE> usage.<P><P>
