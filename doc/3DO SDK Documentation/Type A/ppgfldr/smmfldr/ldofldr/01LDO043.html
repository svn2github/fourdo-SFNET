<Title>CreateCel</Title><A NAME="XREF35656"><H1>CreateCel </A></H1> Creates a cel from scratch.<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>CCB * CreateCel (int32 width, int32 height, int32 bitsPerPixel, int32 options, void *dataBuf)</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3>Creates a cel of any arbitrary type. The parameters provide just enough information to create the basic cel. After the cel is created, you are free to modify the CCB. <P>If you pass a NULL dataBuf pointer, an appropriately-sized buffer is allocated when the cel is created. If you pass a non-NULL dataBuf pointer, it is stored into the ccb_SourcePtr field instead of allocating a buffer internally. <P>The options parameter is one or more of the following values, ORed together as necessary: <P>CREATECEL_CODED-Create a coded cel. bitsPerPixel must be &lt;= 8. <p>CREATECEL_UNCODED-Create an uncoded cel. bitsPerPixel must be 8 or 16. <P>If bitsPerPixel is less than 8, a PLUT is always allocated when the cel is created. If bitsPerPixel is 8 or 16, a PLUT is allocated only if the CREATECEL_CODED option is set. If a PLUT is allocated all its entries are initialized to zero. <P>The cel is created with a position of 0,0 and size and perspective values for a 1:1 mapping. The Preamble Word 1 Blue LSB handling is set to PRE1_TLLSB_PDC0. The PIXC word is set for standard opaque, 0x1F001F00. The cel flags are set to: CCB_LAST | CCB_NPABS | CCB_SPABS | CCB_PPABS | CCB_LDSIZE | CCB_LDPRS | CCB_LDPPMP | CCB_CCBPRE | CCB_YOXY | CCB_USEAV | CCB_NOBLK | CCB_ACE | CCB_ACW | CCB_ACCW <P>Use <CODE>DeleteCel()</CODE> to release all resources allocated for the cel. The cel data buffer and PLUT are released only if they were allocated by <CODE>CreateCel()</CODE>. If you provided your own dataBuf pointer, you must free the buffer yourself. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>width<DD>Width of the cel, and its data buffer, in pixels. </DL><DL><DT>height<DD>Height of the cel, and its data buffer, in pixels. </DL><DL><DT>bitsPerPixel<DD>Bits per pixel value for the cel. </DL><DL><DT>options<DD>Bitmapped options, as described above. </DL><DL><DT>dataBuf<DD>Option data buffer pointer; may be NULL to have a buffer allocated automatically. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Pointer to the new CCB, or NULL if there is not enough memory to make the cel. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in lib3do.lib. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>lib3do.lib, celutils.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01LDO041.html#XREF37012"><CODE>CreateBackdropCel</A>, <A HREF="./01LDO055.html#XREF42213">DeleteCel</A> </CODE><P></CODE>
