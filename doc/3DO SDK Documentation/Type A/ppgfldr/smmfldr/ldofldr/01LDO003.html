<Title>BlitFontChar </Title><A NAME="XREF20398"><H1>BlitFontChar </A></H1> Blits character pixels from font data area into memory buffer.<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>int32 BlitFontChar(FontDescriptor *fDesc,uint32 theChar, void *blitInfo, void *dstBuf,int32 dstX,int32 dstY,int32 dstBPR,int32 dstColorIndex,int32 dstBPP)</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3>Blits character pixels from the font data area into a memory buffer, performing any font format specific data decompression as needed. <P><CODE>BlitFontChar()</CODE> supports the internals of the text library; it should never be necessary to call this function directly from an application program. If you are implementing your own replacement text library, use <CODE>BlitFontChar()</CODE> to render the font character pixels into your own memory buffer. You can use the standard text library source code as a guide in creating your own text library. <P><CODE>BlitFontChar()</CODE> currently supports only 8-bit-per-pixel destination format, and always creates pixels suitable for an 8-bit coded cel with AMV (alternate multiplier value) used to scale pixels already in the cell for anti-aliasing. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>fDesc<DD>Pointer to a FontDescriptor structure. </DL><DL><DT>theChar<DD>The specific character you want to blit to the buffer. </DL><DL><DT>blitInfo<DD>Value returned from <CODE>GetFontCharInfo()</CODE> via its **blitInfo parameter, or NULL. If you pass NULL, an internal call to <CODE>GetFontCharInfo()</CODE> is made. If you are already calling <CODE>GetFontCharInfo()</CODE> before blitting each character, you can eliminate this potentially expensive internal call by saving the blitInfo from your call and passing it to this function. </DL><DL><DT>destBuf<DD>Pointer to the cel buffer into which you want to blit the character pixels. </DL><DL><DT>dstX<DD>X coordinate within the destBuf. </DL><DL><DT>dstY<DD>Y coordinate within the destBuf. </DL><DL><DT>dstBPR<DD>Bytes-per-row of the destBuf. </DL><DL><DT>dstColorIndex<DD>For 8-bit-per-pixel destination buffers, the color index to OR into each pixel as the character pixels are placed into the buffer. The value must be in the range of 0 through 3 inclusive. </DL><DL><DT>dstBPP<DD>Bits-per-pixel of the destination buffer. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Width of the character, in pixels. Zero indicates no pixels were placed in the destination buffer because the character is not within the range of characters stored in the font.<P><H3>Associated Files</H3>lib3do.lib, fontlib.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01LDO078.html#XREF37606"><CODE>GetFontCharInfo</A></CODE><P></CODE>
