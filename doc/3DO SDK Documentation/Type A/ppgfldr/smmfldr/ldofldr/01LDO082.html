In other words, this function is probably appropriate for debugging and performance measurement, but may NOT be appropriate for a final application, since some application environments (such as cable TV) are almost certain to run on a machine powered on for months at a time. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>ioreq<DD>An IOReq item obtained from <CODE>GetTimerIOReq()</CODE>, or zero to have an IOReq dynamically created/deleted during the call. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Returns positive number of hundredths-of-a-second or a negative error code. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in lib3do.lib. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>lib3do.lib, timerutils.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01LDO096.html#XREF14731"><CODE>GetTimerIOReq</A></CODE><P></CODE>
