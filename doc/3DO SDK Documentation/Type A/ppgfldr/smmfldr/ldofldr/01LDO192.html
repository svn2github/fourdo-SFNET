The thread's priority is set to your task's priority plus the delta_priority. After calling this function, your task and all its child threads can use timer services. <P>The service thread doesn't use many CPU cycles, and it uses them only when you make requests for services and when time events occur. Generally, you should run the service thread at a slightly higher priority than the rest of your tasks/threads, especially if timely notifications are critical. <P>If this function returns positive 1, that indicates that someone else has already started the service thread. In this case, you should respond by calling <CODE>TimerServicesOpen()</CODE> to connect with the already-running thread. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>delta_priority<DD>A value added to your task's priority, the value becomes the thread's priority.</DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Zero on success, one if the thread is already running, or a negative error code. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in lib3do.lib. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>lib3do.lib, timerutils.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><A HREF="./01LDO190.html#XREF29290"><CODE>TimerServicesOpen</A></CODE><P>
