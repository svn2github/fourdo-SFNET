Either pointer can be NULL. The loworder part of the VBL timer is generally of most interest, it doesn't roll over into the high-order part until roughly 800 days of continuous running without a reboot. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>ioreq<DD>IOReq item obtained from<CODE> GetTimerIOReq()</CODE>, or zero to have an IOReq dynamically created/deleted during the call. </DL><DL><DT>hiorder<DD>Pointer to a variable into which the high-order portion of the VBL time is stored. </DL><DL><DT>loworder<DD>Pointer to a variable into which the low-order portion of the VBL time is stored. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>The low-order portion of the VBL time (a positive value), or a negative error code. <P><H3>Implementation</H3>Library call implemented in lib3do.lib. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>lib3do.lib, timerutils.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><A HREF="./01LDO096.html#XREF14731"><CODE>GetTimerIOReq</A></CODE><P>
