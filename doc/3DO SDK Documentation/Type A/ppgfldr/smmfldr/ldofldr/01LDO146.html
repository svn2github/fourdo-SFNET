<Title>ReadFile</Title><A NAME="XREF13085"><H1>ReadFile </A></H1> Reads a file or a portion of one into memory<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>int ReadFile (char *filename, int32 size, long *buffer, long offset)</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3><CODE>ReadFile()</CODE> uses the file system to read a file or a portion of a file into memory. It performs up to four retries on each block read if the filesystem returns an error. <P><CODE>ReadFile()</CODE> is useful for loading a portion of a file, optionally starting at some offset into the file. For loading an entire file starting at offset zero, the <CODE>LoadFile()</CODE> function is three to four times faster. <P><CODE>ReadFile() </CODE>fills the buffer with size bytes, beginning at offset. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>filename<DD>Pointer to a string containing a valid pathname for a file in the currently mounted file system. </DL><DL><DT>size<DD>Number of bytes to read. </DL><DL><DT>buffer<DD>Pointer to a buffer into which the data will be read. Must be large enough to hold size bytes. </DL><DL><DT>offset<DD>Offset from the beginning of the file at which the read begins. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>The number of bytes read, or -1 if an error occurred. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>lib3do.lib, parse3do.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><A HREF="./01LDO115.html#XREF27218"><CODE>LoadFile</A> </CODE><P>
