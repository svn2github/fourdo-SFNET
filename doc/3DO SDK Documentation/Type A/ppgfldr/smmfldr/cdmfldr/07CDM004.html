<TITLE>Optimization Issues</TITLE><H1>Optimization Issues</H1>To minimize startup time and file access time, consider the following issues: <UL><LI> A title that uses the optimized layout procedure described in this document usually has better file access time than a title that uses the simple layout only. An exception may be a title using custom layout fine-tuned by the developer. <li> If you use the optimized layout procedure described in this document, it is critical that the person collecting access information is thoroughly familiar with the title. <li> Catapult is a relatively new feature to speed up startup time. Since the effect of Catapult depends on the title in question, consider preparing one image using Catapult, one without, and comparing the two. </UL>
