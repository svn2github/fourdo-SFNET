Running the title on a testing station simulates what the end-user will experience on a 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system. <P>The 3DO Testing Station is a version of the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system that has been modified so you can switch between encrypted and unencrypted CD-ROMs. This allows you to play both encrypted discs and unencrypted discs on the same station.<P>The only external difference to the Interactive Multiplayer is the ROM switch located at the rear of the player. In the DOWN position, the player reads and plays unencrypted discs. In the UP position, it reads and plays encrypted discs.<P>
