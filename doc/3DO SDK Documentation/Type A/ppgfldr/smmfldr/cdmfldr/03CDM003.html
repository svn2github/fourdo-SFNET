<TITLE>Preparing Simple cdrom.image Files</TITLE><H1><A NAME="XREF29116">Preparing Simple cdrom.image Files</A></H1>The first step in creating your CD-ROM is to generate a simple, nonoptimized <I>cdrom.image</I> file. You create the CD-ROM image file using the <CODE>laytool</CODE> program. This program uses a <I>cdrom.tcl</I> script file to create the image file. This section describes: <P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF29196">Editing the cdrom.tcl File for the Simple Image</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF13372">Creating the Simple Image</A></UL>All files and folders needed to create the image file are in the /<I>cdrommaster </I>folder named after the current version of the operating system.<P>To step through this section, you should have already set up your files, as explained in <A HREF="./03CDM002.html#XREF34059">Preparing Your Title's Files for the Layout Process</A>.<P><H3>About the cdrom.tcl File</H3>The <I>cdrom.tcl</I> script file contains variables that affect the final form of the CD-ROM image file. Variables are defined with <CODE>set</CODE> commands in the script. If a command is preceded by an initial hash sign (#), it is considered a comment and won't execute. <P><A NAME="XREF29196"><H2>Editing the cdrom.tcl File for the Simple Image</A></H2>To edit the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file for first-time layout, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Launch MPW.<p><LI>From the Directory menu, choose Set Directory and select the folder inside the <I>cdrommaster</I> folder that is named like the most recent operating system.<p><LI>From the File menu, choose Open and select the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file. <p><p><B>Note: </B>The cdrom.tcl file is commented extensively; if you pay attention to the comments, you should find editing the file quite easy.<BR><p><LI>Edit the file so the variables have the values shown in the table below: <PRE><B>Table 1: </B><I> Variable settings for simple image creation.</I>--------------------------------------------------------Variable      |Setting                                  --------------------------------------------------------imagefile     |Pathname of a cdrom.image file to be                   |created on a hard disk that has at least               |640 MB space.                            --------------------------------------------------------label         |Set to "cd-rom" during initial testing of              |the CD-ROM image.                        --------------------------------------------------------takedirectory |Pathname of the /takeme folder that                    |contains the title.                      --------------------------------------------------------megabytes     |Rule of Thumb: Use 110% of the size of                 |the /takeme folder (with your executable               |and data files), and use that number as                |the number of megabytes. If you allocate               |too little, the layout process                         |terminates. If you allocate too much, the              |process takes longer but there won't be                |other problems.
