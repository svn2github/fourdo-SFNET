<TITLE>Overview of Encryption Requirements</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF15476">Overview of Encryption Requirements</LINK></H1><HR>When you submit a title for encryption, 3DO CD Operations checks that all requirements are met before starting the encryption process. This document summarizes the requirements, providing references to more detailed information as appropriate. <P><B>Warning: </B>3DO CD Operations will not encrypt titles that don't meet the requirements outlined here.<P><H2>Minimum memory testing</H2>3DO Quality Assurance tests each title in both in the minimum memory environment, and in the nonrestricted full-memory environment. Each title is briefly tested before encryption, then for seven days after encryption. <P>You can run the minmem utility in one of two ways: <P><UL><LI>Type <CODE>minmem</CODE> at the Debugger prompt after running the boot script but before launching your application.<p><LI>Include <CODE>minmem</CODE> in the <I>AppStartup</I> script.</UL>See <A HREF="./02CDM004.html#XREF37473">Testing Your Title in the Minimum Memory Configuration</A> for more information.<P><H2>Low memory access</H2>Your title must be low memory clean. See <A HREF="./02CDM003.html#XREF27784">Checking for Low Memory Pointers</A> for more information.<P><H2>Three-Second 3DO licensed product symbol</H2>Each application is required to display the 3DO licensed product symbol, in at least quarter-screen height, for a minimum of three seconds when the title boots up. <P>Use the files containing the 3DO licensed product symbol which are included on the installation CD-ROM at top level in the "Approved 3DO Logo Art" folder.<P>The three-second 3DO licensed product symbol is not required if the title uses a banner screen (see <A HREF="./03CDM002.html#XREF24558">Preparing and Using a Banner Screen</A>). <P><H2>CD packaging and artwork</H2>CD artwork and CD packaging artwork are inspected for adherence to 3DO guidelines. <I>Artwork within the application is not censored in any way</I>; only the CD surface and CD packaging artwork must conform to certain guidelines. <P>The approval process is described in the Essentials Kit. <P>Files you have to deliver<P>3DO Developer Services needs to see the <I>/takeme</I> directory of your title to verify that you created your <I>cdrom.image</I> file with the appropriate 3DO system files.<P><p>When you submit your title for encryption, include <UL><LI>the <I>cdrom.image</I> file<p><LI>the <I>/takeme</I> directory (without executable and data files). </UL>Deliver these files in HFS format on CD-ROM. Send at least two copies. See the Disc Processing Form for detail; a copy of that form is required for encryption. <P><H3>For More Information</H3>The information above is only an overview of encryption requirements.
