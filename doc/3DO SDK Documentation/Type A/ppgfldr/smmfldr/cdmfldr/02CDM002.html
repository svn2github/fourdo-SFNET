During development, the pathname is then resolved to <I>/remote/art</I> since the program booted from <I>/remote</I>. <P>A title should use <I>$boot</I> and other aliases explicitly only in cases where an absolute path is needed because the program would not know how to resolve a relative pathname. Generally, all programs should be able to resolve a relative pathname, with the current location being the point from which the program was entered.<P><B>Warning: </B>Never use /remote in a pathname; it won't be available on an end-user machine. <P><A NAME="XREF30313"><H2>Hints on Error Checking and Other Advice</A></H2>Here are some common problems and advice on how to avoid them: <P><UL><LI>Check all function return values. Make sure a function never exits the program if an error results and that returned pointer values are not <CODE>NULL</CODE>.<p><LI>Use printf() to facilitate debugging<B>. </B>The <CODE>printf()</CODE> statements in your program statements are displayed in the Debugger Terminal window when you run the application in Debugger mode. The<CODE> printf()</CODE> statements are dropped when you run in stand-alone mode. <p><p><B>Note: </B>Once you have generated a clean <I>cdrom.image</I> file, eliminate the <CODE>printf()</CODE> statements for a slightly more efficient title.<BR><p><LI>Don't use OpenMacLink(). The function is obsolete.<p><LI>Read an integral number of blocks. When reading files from the CD-ROM, you must read an integral number of disc blocks. For example, if CMD_Status reports that the blocksize is 2048, and the file size is 3277 bytes, you <I>must</I> read 4096 bytes. <p><LI>Don't forget to recompile and retest. If you changed your application don't forget to recompile it and test it once more. </UL>
