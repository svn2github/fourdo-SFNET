Therefore, prepare your Macintosh as follows: <P><OL><LI>Disconnect the Macintosh from any networks and shut down all network drivers. <p><LI>Remove system extensions that attempt to monitor SCSI bus activity, such as those that implement flashing menu bar icons to show disk activity.<p><LI>Keep the compact disc recorder in a stable environment, in particular: <p><UL><LI>Make sure there is no movement near the recorder; it can cause a faulty CD-ROM disc. <p><LI>Don't place the Macintosh hard drive on top of the recorder or near loudspeakers.</UL><BR></OL><A NAME="XREF34445"><H2>Setting Up the QuickTOPiX Software</A></H2>The QuickTOPiX software lets you master a CD-ROM disc in several different formats, two of which you use during the mastering process: <P><UL><LI>Choosing Block Image creates a disc in 3DO format for testing.<p><LI>Choosing Apple HFS image creates an HFS disc for delivery to the 3DO Company for encryption.</UL>This section discusses setting up the software for both image formats and lists the files created during that process.<P><B>Note: </B>Setting up the software for both image formats before starting the mastering process saves time and trouble later. <P><H3>Setup for Mastering a CD-ROM for Testing</H3>To set up the software for mastering a CD-ROM disc for testing, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Make sure that you have installed the latest version of the QuickTOPiX software, including the QuickTOPiX system extension. <p><LI>Find the QuickTOPiX Chooser folder in the QuickTOPiX folder on your Macintosh.<p><LI>Double-click on the Block Image icon in the QuickTOPiX Chooser folder. <p><p>The setup screen for recording a CD-ROM image file to disc appears. This type of recording creates a disc for testing. <p><IMG SRC="Figures/BlockImage.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>QuickTOPiX setup screen for block image format.</I><P><LI>Type in the company name and operator name, deselect the Preview check box in the Make section, and click OK. <p><LI>In the dialog box that appears, click Yes to save your changes.</OL><H3>Setup for Mastering a CD-ROM for Encryption</H3>To set up the software for mastering an HFS image, follow these steps:<P><OL><LI>Double-click on the Apple HFS icon. <P><p>The Apple HFS setup screen for mastering a disc of an entire Macintosh volume appears.
