This is similar to the effect achieved by pointing a television camera at a monitor showing the image from the camera: You see an image of the monitor on the monitor. The monitor image contains the same image and so on. This recursive feedback can generate fractal patterns in real time. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>-g<DD>Start without waiting for a button press. </DL><DL><DT>-m<DD>Never enter Auto mode. </DL><H3>Associated Files</H3>colorecho_tools.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Graphics/colorecho <P>
