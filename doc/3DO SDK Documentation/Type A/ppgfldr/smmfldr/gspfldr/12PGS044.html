The control pad has the following functions: <P><UL><LI>A Button-Add a 16-bit uncoded cel (bouncing ball). <LI>B Button-Toggle between using one or two cel engines. <LI>C Button-Remove a 16-bit uncoded cel (bouncing ball). </UL><H3>Caveats</H3>The cels used in this example are expensive to render and not well-suited for titles attempting to maximize performance. <P>The example contains a large amount of code which has been marked with #ifdef and may be difficult to follow at times. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>perftest.c, sprite.h, sprite.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Graphics/Performance_Test<P>
