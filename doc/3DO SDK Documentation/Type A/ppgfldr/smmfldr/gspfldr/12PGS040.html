<Title>minmax_audio</Title><A NAME="XREF25472"><H1>minmax_audio </A></H1><A NAME="XREF11410"></A>Measures the maximum and minimum output from the DSP.<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>minmax_audio</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3>Samples the output of the DSP and returns its maximum and minimum output values. You can use minmax_audio to check that your program outputs are reasonable, non-clipping levels of audio. <P>The program creates instances of probes from the instruments minimum.dsp and maximum.dsp. The probes are queried with <CODE>ReadProbe()</CODE> every five seconds, or 5*240 audio ticks. <P>In Opera hardware, the DSP implementation is 16-bit; therefore, the output for the left and right channels range from 32767 to -32768. <P><H3>Caveats</H3>The loudness of audio is often subjective. Check the loudness of your program by first playing a standard audio CD on a development station, and adjusting the volume of your sound system to a reasonable level. The 3DO program should then produce sounds at a similar volume. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>minmax_audio.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Audio <P>
