It illustrates the convenience routines <CODE>GetMouse()</CODE> and <CODE>GetControlPad(</CODE>. <P><H3>Caveats</H3>While the control pad and mouse convenience routines is fine for certain titles, titles that require a high level of performance should use the Event Broker directly. This is particularly true if you want to put peripheral input handling in its own thread. <P>See the BrokerShell example program for programming directly to the Event Broker. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>mouseufo.c, mouseufo.make, padandmouse.c, padandmouse.h,    audiohandler.c,audiohandler.h, playbgndmusic.c, playbgndmusic.make<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/EventBroker/Mouse<P>
