Data can only be written in blocks, not bytes. If the data being written is not a multiple of the target device's blocksize, the last chunk of data must be copied to a buffer which is the size of a block, and the block can then be written. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>nvram.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Nvram <P>
