It does this by selecting a MIDI note number, which the audio folio maps to a frequency. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>sample file<DD>Name of a sample to be played. The sample should be compatible with sampler.dsp (16-bit monophonic).</DL><DL><DT>duration<DD>Duration of each note, in audio ticks. Defaults to 240.</DL><H3>Caveats</H3>Because this sample program uses <CODE>SleepaudioTicks()</CODE>, the notes are not necessarily rhythmic. Use the juggler to play rhythmic scores. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>ta_pitchnotes.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Audio <P>
