As it detects errors and illegal operations, it displays information in the Debugger Terminal window. <P>For more information about the memory debugging subsystem, refer to the documentation for the <CODE>CreateMemDebug()</CODE> function. <P><H3>Caveats</H3>This program intentionally does a some illegal things. Don't do this in your programs!<P><H3>Associated Files</H3>memdebug.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Kernel <P>
