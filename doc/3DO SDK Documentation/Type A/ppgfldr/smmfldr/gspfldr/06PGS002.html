This memory will probably not be given DMA access, which will cause problems for objects that need this service. Particularly at risk are CCBs and audio buffers. Always allocate the memory for these structures by using <CODE>AllocMem()</CODE> with the appropriate MemType.<P>Avoid declarations of the following type:<P><CODE><PRE>MyRoutine (){    CCB    myCel;        .        .        .}</CODE></PRE>Instead, follow this example:<P><CODE><PRE>MyRoutine (){    CCB    *myCel;    myCel = AllocMem (sizeof (CCB), MEMTYPE_CEL);        .        .        .    if (myCel) FreeMem (myCel, sizeof (CCB));}</CODE></PRE>It is especially important that you modify your code to anticipate this. The penalty for trying to DMA from non-DMA memory is having your task terminated.<P>
