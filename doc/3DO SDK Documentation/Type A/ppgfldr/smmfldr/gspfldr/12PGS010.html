You can also distort the cel and clear the screen. The program supports control pad, joystick, and mouse interaction.<P>This example illustrates how to use the broker shell peripheral interaction utilities. <P>The connection/configuration/disconnection routines can be used as-is in final code. <P>The data interaction/processing is less efficient than it could be for the sake of modularity, comprehensibility, and flexibility. If you unpack the<CODE> BS_NiceWaitEvent()</CODE> and <CODE>BS_ProcessXxxData()</CODE> routines and perform that processing in a more direct way performance will improve. You should also eliminate any debouncing checks that you don't use. <P>Joystick controls <P><DL><DT>Stick<DD>move in x and y</DL><DL><DT>Z <DD>zoom in/out U/D/</DL><DL><DT>L/R switch<DD>deform cel </DL><DL><DT>Trigger<DD>leave copy of cel on screen </DL><DL><DT>A<DD>clear screen </DL><DL><DT>B <DD>recalibrate stick (to recalibrate, hit B with stick in neutral position and move the stick and z throttle to the limits of travel) </DL><DL><DT>C<DD>quit </DL><DL><DT>RightShift<DD>switch to mouse </DL>Mouse controls <P><DL><DT>LeftButton<DD>leave copy of cel on screen </DL><DL><DT>MiddleButton<DD>clear screen </DL><DL><DT>Movement<DD>move cel in x and y </DL>Pad 1 controls (used with mouse): <P><DL><DT>RightButton<DD>switch to joystick </DL><DL><DT>D Pad<DD>distort cel </DL><DL><DT>C Button<DD>quit </DL><DL><DT>RightShift<DD>toggle mouse edge conditions between bound &amp; wrap </DL>Pad 2 controls (only if there are 2 pads and no mouse): <P><DL><DT>D Pad<DD>move cel </DL><DL><DT>A Button<DD>leave copy of cel on screen </DL><DL><DT>B Button<DD>clear screen </DL><DL><DT>C Button<DD>switch to joystick control </DL><DL><DT>RightShift<DD>toggle movement speed between high &amp; low </DL><H3>Caveats</H3>Lightgun support is not yet included in this example. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>cloud.cel<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/EventBroker/Control_Port_Peripherals<P>
