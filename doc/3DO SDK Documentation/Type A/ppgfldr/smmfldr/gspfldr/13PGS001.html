You should call this from the task or thread which has already called <CODE>InitControlPad()</CODE>. This is because of system restrictions on item ownership and using items. <CODE>InitControlPad()</CODE> and <CODE>InitEventUtility()</CODE> create message ports and message items, which only the task which has created them can use. Hence, <CODE>DoControlPad()</CODE> can only be called by that same task. Other tasks or threads which attempt this, will get errors due to not owning the appropriate message ports and messages. <P>To make this multi-thread capable, you would need to spawn off a thread that communicates directly with the event broker, and with all the other tasks that will consume event information. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>controlpad.c, controlpad.h<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/ExamplesLib <P><H3>See Also</H3><A HREF="./13PGS002.html#XREF22018"><CODE>InitControlPad</A>, <A HREF="./13PGS003.html#XREF23856">KillControlPad</A> </CODE><P>
