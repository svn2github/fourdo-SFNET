<Title>CoalRiver</Title><A NAME="XREF31523"><H1>CoalRiver </A></H1><A NAME="XREF17118"> </A>Plays a MIDI file using Juggler and Score toolbox.<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>CoalRiver</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3>This program plays a MIDI file using Juggler and Score toolbox from the music.lib and audio folio, and demonstrates special MIDI interpreter functions. <P>The CoalRiver.pimap file references some AIFF samples which were included in the AIFF Samples folder. It is necessary to copy the AIFF Samples folder into the remote folder to use them in this program. To let this program know about the locations of the samples, use this command in the Debugger Terminal window:<P><DL><DD><CODE>alias samples &lt;sample path&gt; </CODE><BR></DL>Then, the CoalRiver.pimap file will reference the appropriate samples. <P><H3>Caveats</H3>No attempt was made to reduce the size of the samples. Most real-world titles use fewer or smaller samples. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3><DL><DT>CoalRiver.c    <DD>Source code.</DL><DL><DT>CoalRiver.imag <DD>Background image which contains program instructions.</DL><DL><DT>CoalRiver.mf <DD>MIDI format song.
