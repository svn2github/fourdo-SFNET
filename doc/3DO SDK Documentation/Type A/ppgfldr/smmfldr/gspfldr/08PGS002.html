<TITLE>Daisy-Chaining Peripherals</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF12865">Daisy-Chaining Peripherals</LINK></H1><HR>Daisy-chaining refers to linking two or more peripherals in series off the control port of a single 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system. Any combination of peripherals that have available female DB9 connectors can be daisy chained.<P>To create a daisy chain, connect to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system (or 3DO development system) to any peripheral that has a female DB9 connector. Then plug the male DB9 connector of a second peripheral into the female DB9 connector of the first, and so on. <P>A peripheral without a female DB9 connector must be the final device in a daisy chain.<P>Because a theoretically unlimited number of peripherals can be daisy-chained, the control port has no fixed maximum number of devices. The number of devices that can be daisy-chained is limited only by the bandwidth of the port. When too many peripherals are linked (usually more than eight), the port becomes overwhelmed and fails to recognize the last device in the chain.<P>For more information, see Chapter 9, "Understanding Devices and I/O," in <A HREF="../../pgsfldr/spg/00spg1.html#XREF38776">3DO System Programmer's Guide</A>.<P>
