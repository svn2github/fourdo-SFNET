It constructs two synthetic sequences based on the TestData data structure, and creates a collection based on these two sequences. It then "plays" the collection via a simple print function, processed at the time of each event in each sequence. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>tj_multi.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Audio/Juggler <P>
