This gives your title a user-friendly way of making space for saving scores or states. Several titles have already used this mechanism so consumers are starting to accept it as a standard. <P>Feel free to modify the art work provided to give the storagetuner a feel that more closely approximates your own title. You may remove the 3DO licensed product symbol used in the example. If you don't, take care not to use it improperly.<P><H3>Associated Files</H3>st.c, st.h, stlists.c, stlists.h, stmem.c, stmem.h, storagetuner.h,<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Nvram <P>
