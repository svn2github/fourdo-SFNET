Issue calls which control the sound effects player instrument (the SampleInfo's si_Player structure member).</UL>During program termination: <P><UL><LI>Call <CODE>ehDisposeSampleInfo()</CODE> for each sound effect. <LI>Call <CODE>ehDisposeMixerInfo()</CODE> for the mixer. <LI>Call <CODE>ehKillEffectsHandler()</CODE>. Close the audio folio. </UL>Depending on program requirements, you may want to load one or more sound effects and assemble their player apparati but not immediately connect them to a mixer. This is accomplished by calling <CODE>ehNewSampleInfo()</CODE> and <CODE>ehSetupSamplePlayer()</CODE>. When you want to connect the player to the mixer, call <CODE>ehConnectSamplePlayer()</CODE>. <P><H3>Caveats</H3>This program is not a complete sound management facility. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3><DL><DT>effectshandler.c effectshandler.h </DL><H3>Location</H3>examples/ExamplesLib <P>
