While the program is running, the user can do the following: <P><UL><LI>A button-Adds a set of 3 components to the animation. <LI>B button-Starts rotating the components in 2D. Pressing the button starts 3D rotation. Pressing the button again stops rotation. <LI>C button-Starts to rapidly resize the components from large to small and back. Pressing the button again stops this. <LI>P button-Pauses and unpauses the animation. <LI>X button-Exits the program. </UL>The program adapts to NTSC vs. PAL automatically. Upon startup, the program loads in an image file to use as a backdrop. It also loads three ANIM files to use for the three components of the 3DO logo. Different versions of the pictures are loaded depending on whether the display is NTSC or PAL. <P>Once all components are loaded, a screen group with two screens is created. The two screens are used for double-buffering. Throughout the animation, we use a SPORT transfer to copy the backdrop image from its buffer into the screen buffer that is not currently displayed. We then render the current set of components onto the screen buffer. Once all this is completed, we swap screen buffers, which makes the rendering visible. The cycle starts again with the newly hidden screen buffer. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>symanim.c, sprite.c, sprite.h<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Graphics/symanim <P>
