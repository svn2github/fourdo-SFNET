These threads sit in a loop and count. After a given number of iterations through their loop, they send a signal to the parent task. When the parent task gets a signal, it wakes up and prints the current counters of the threads to show how much they were able to count. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>signals.c<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Kernel <P>
