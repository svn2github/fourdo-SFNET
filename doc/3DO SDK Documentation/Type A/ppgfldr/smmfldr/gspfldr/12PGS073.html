The user can select a different sound to loop by pressing the A, B, or C buttons on the control pad. The last button pressed corresponds to the sound being played. <P>This program demonstrates how one might use the advanced sound player as an engine for doing environmentally-sensitive soundtrack playback. Note that the sound being played doesn't change to the newly selected one until the end of the current sound is reached. This demonstrates, for example how a score might be made to change at the next musically sensible point. See tsp_rooms for another way to do this. <P>Control pad operation: <P><UL><LI>A-Select sound #1. <LI>B-Select sound #2.<LI>C-Select sound #3. <LI>X-Stop, quit when done playing. <LI>Shift-X-Quit immediately. <LI>Start-Toggle pause on/off. </UL><H3>Associated Files</H3>tsp_switcher.c, <P>$samples<P><H3>Location</H3>examples/Audio/Advanced_Sound_Player<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="../../mgsfldr/mprfldr/02mpr068.html#XREF24761">spCreatePlayer</A>,<A HREF="./12PGS071.html#XREF30384">tsp_rooms</A>,<A HREF="./12PGS070.html#XREF12219">tsp_algorithmic</A><P></CODE>
