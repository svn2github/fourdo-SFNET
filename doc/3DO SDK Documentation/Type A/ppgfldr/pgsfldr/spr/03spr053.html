The results of the product are deposited in the destination matrix in each object structure pointed to by the objectlist array. <P>The object structure argument defines offsets within objects to the elements to be manipulated. The definition for ObjOffset2 is as follows: <P>typedef struct ObjOffset2 {int32 oo2_DestMatOffset; int32 oo2_SrcMatOffset;} ObjOffset2; <P><UL><LI>oo2_DestMatOffset is the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of an object structure to where to write the result of the matrix to multiply. <LI>oo2_SrcMatOffset is the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of an object structure to the location of the matrix to be multiplied. </UL><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>objectlist<DD>An array of pointers to object structures to modify. </DL><DL><DT>offsetstruct<DD>A pointer to the source object structure that defines offsets within object's to the elements to be multiplied. </DL><DL><DT>mat<DD>A 3x3 matrix of 16.16 fractions to be multiplied. </DL><DL><DT>count<DD>The number of vectors for the multiplication. </DL><H3>Implementation</H3>SWI implemented in operamath V20. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>operamath.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./03spr054.html#XREF40677"><CODE>MulObjectMat44_F16</A>() </CODE><P></CODE>
