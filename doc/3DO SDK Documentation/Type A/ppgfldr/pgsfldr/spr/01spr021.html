<Title>CreateIOReq</Title><A NAME="XREF36930"><H1>CreateIOReq </A></H1><A NAME="XREF39857"></A>Creates an I/O request.<P><H3>Synopsis</H3><CODE>Item CreateIOReq( const char *name, uint8 pri, Item dev, Item mp )</CODE><P><H3>Description</H3>This convenience procedure creates an I/O request item. <P>When you create an I/O request, you must decide how the device will notify you when an I/O operation completes. There are two choices: <P><UL><LI>Notification by signal <LI>Notification by message </UL>With notification by signal, the device will send your task the SIGF_IODONE signal whenever an I/O operation completes. This is a low-overhead mechanism, which is also low on information. When you get the signal, all you know is that an I/O operation has completed. You do not know which operation has completed. This has to be determined by looking at the state of all outstanding I/O requests. <P>Notification by message involves slightly more overhead, but provides much more information. When you create the I/O request, you indicate a message port. Whenever an I/O operation completes, the device will send a message to that message port. The message will contain the following information: <P><UL><LI>msg_Result Contains the io_Error value from the I/O request. This indicates the state of the I/O operation, whether it worked or failed. <LI>msg_DataPtr Contains the item number of the I/O request that completed. <LI>msg_DataSize Contains the value of the ioi_User field taken from the IOInfo structure used when initiating the I/O operation. </UL><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>name<DD>The name of the I/O request (see "Notes").</DL><DL><DT>pri<DD>The priority of the I/O request. For some device drivers, this value determines the order in which I/O requests are processed. When in doubt about what value to use, use 0. </DL><DL><DT>dev<DD>The item number of the device to which to send the I/O request. </DL><DL><DT>mp<DD>If a task wants to receive a message when an I/O request is finished, this argument must be the item number of the message port to receive the message. If the task wants to receive a signal when an I/O request is finished instead of a message, this argument must be 0. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>The procedure returns the item number of the new I/O request or one of the following error codes if an error occurs: <P><DL><DT>BADITEM<DD>The mp argument was not zero but did not specify a valid message port. </DL><DL><DT>ER_Kr_ItemNotOpen<DD>The device specified by the dev argument is not open. </DL><DL><DT>NOMEM<DD>There was not enough memory to complete the operation. </DL><H3>Implementation</H3>Convenience call implemented in clib.lib V20. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3><DL><DT>io.h<DD>ANSI C Prototype </DL><DL><DT>clib.lib<DD>ARM Link Library </DL><H3>Notes</H3>When you no longer need an I/O request, use <CODE>DeleteIOReq()</CODE> to delete it. <P>You can use <CODE>FindNamedItem()</CODE> to find a I/O request by name. When creating I/O requests, you should assign unique names whenever possible. <P>The kernel may change the priority of an I/O request to help optimize throughput. <P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01spr031.html#XREF13807"><CODE>DeleteIOReq</A>() </CODE><P></CODE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF36930"></LINK></H1><HR>
