This means that: <P><UL><LI>Memory that was allocated by a thread also belongs to the parent task. <LI>Memory that was allocated by a thread is not automatically deallocated when the thread is deleted but instead remains the property of the parent task. </UL>If you create a thread using <CODE>CreateThread()</CODE>, you must delete it using <CODE>DeleteThread()</CODE>, which does special cleanup work. <P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01spr028.html#XREF27054"><CODE>CreateThread</A>(), <A HREF="./01spr042.html#XREF40201">exit</A>() </CODE><P></CODE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF28597"></LINK></H1><HR>
