This has the same effect as using <CODE>printf()</CODE> to print the who, what, and whom strings with the string constructed by <CODE>GetSysErr()</CODE>. <P>On non-DEVELOPMENT builds, this macro expands to an empty statement, reducing code size and avoiding pulling in lots of extraneous junk from the support libraries. <P>To copy an error string into a buffer instead of sending it the console, use <CODE>GetSysErr()</CODE>. <P>In the task called "shell", the C statement <P>PrintError((char *)0, "open", filename, errno) <P>might result in something like this: <P>+================ Terminal ================ | FFS-Severe-System-extended-No such file | shell: unable to open "badfile" <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>who<DD>A string that identifies the task, folio, or module that encountered the error; if a NULL pointer or a zero-length string is passed, the name of the current task is used (or, if there is no current task, "notask"). </DL><DL><DT>what<DD>A string that describes what action was being taken that failed. Normally, the words "unable to" are printed before this string to save client data space; if the first character of the "what" string is a backslash, these words are not printed. </DL><DL><DT>whom<DD>A string that describes the object to which the described action is being taken (for instance, the name of a file). It is printed surrounded by quotes; if a NULL pointer or zero length string is passed, the quotes are not printed. </DL><DL><DT>err<DD>A (normally negative) number denoting the error that occurred, which will be decoded with GetSysErr. If not negative, then no decoded error will be printed. </DL><H3>Implementation</H3>Macro implemented in the operror.h V21. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3><DL><DT>operror.h<DD>ANSI C Prototype </DL><DL><DT>clib.lib<DD>ARM Link Library </DL><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./01spr108.html#XREF37909">PrintfSysErr()</A> </CODE>, <CODE><A HREF="./01spr080.html#XREF41016">GetSysErr()</A> </CODE><P><H1><LINK NAME="XREF18183"></LINK></H1><HR>
