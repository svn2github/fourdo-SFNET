This flushes any data left to be output by the decompressor and generally cleans things up. <P><H3>Arguments</H3><DL><DT>decomp<DD>An active decompression handle, as obtained from CreateDecompressor(). Once this call is made, the decompression handle becomes invalid and can no longer be used. </DL><H3>Return Value</H3>Returns &gt;= 0 for success, or a negative error code if it fails. Possible error codes include: <P><DL><DT>COMP_ERR_BADPTR<DD>An invalid decompression handle was supplied. </DL><DL><DT>COMP_ERR_DATAREMAINS<DD>The decompressor thinks it is finished, but there remains extra data in its buffers. This happens when the compressed data is somehow corrupt. </DL><DL><DT>COMP_ERR_DATAMISSING<DD>The decompressor thinks that not all of the compressed data was given to be decompressed. This happens when the compressed data is somehow corrupt. </DL><H3>Implementation</H3>Folio call implemented in compression folio V24. <P><H3>Associated Files</H3>compression.h<P><H3>See Also</H3><CODE><A HREF="./08spr002.html#XREF38875"><CODE>CreateCompressor</A>() </CODE><P></CODE>
