This is not possible in this release of the hardware. <P><H2>The CLUT bypass option</H2><UL><LI>While converting the source art, you need to set the CLUT bypass option for the image to force a standard VDL for any pixel for which the high bit is set.<p><LI>The program that displays the cel needs to set the high bit in the cel using the <CODE>SetCEControl()</CODE> function.</UL>The frame buffer will now use the standard (system-supplied) VDL instead of the custom VDL for each pixel that has the high bit set-that is, for each pixel that is part of the specially prepared cel. <P><B>Note: </B>You can have transparent and opaque cel pixels on top of an image that uses a custom VDL. Translucent cels will not work correctly even if you have turned on the CLUT bypass option because the cel engine assumes a linear ascending CLUT. <P>
