For example, the Protosubscriber does not support queued data, the CelSubscriber does. This section looks at how video and audio data would be handled differently in a simple fly-through application. <P><H2>Video data</H2>Consider an interactive fly-through type of stream, where a button press causes a turn down a different path in the fly-through world. There are two options: <P><UL><LI>Graphics from a path that was just departed from should no longer be displayed, so flushing queued data would be appropriate. <p><LI>When looping through a section of a stream, it might be desirable to use, and not flush, queued data. For example, the loop might be repeated a couple of times, followed by continuing through the stream. In this case, having the data already in memory would be useful.</UL><H2>Audio data</H2>Now consider what to do with audio data in the fly-though example. It is undesirable to cease playing the active sound to avoid an audio gap. One way to prevent a gap is to segment the sampled audio or MIDI data in the stream file. As a result, positioning from an appropriate departure point to a new section will result in a seamless transition to the audio stored in the stream at the destination of the positioning operation. Another way to solve this problem is to use the positioning event to trigger a cross fade from the queued audio data to the new audio data obtained after the positioning operation.<P><P>
