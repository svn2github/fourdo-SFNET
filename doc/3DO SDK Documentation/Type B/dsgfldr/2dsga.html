The stream file contains all video, audio, and other data in a compressed and interleaved form and contains timestamps. This section explains basic concepts and terminology.

The numbers are the timestamp associated with each data chunk. In the output stream, the shaded areas are filler placed in the stream to pad the data to the logical block size.<P><IMG SRC="Figures/DSG.2-1.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 1: </B><I>Three chunk files are merged to create a single stream file.</I><P></OL><A NAME="XREF30034"><H2>Stream file terminology</A></H2>Select one of the following terms for more information:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF29424">Stream file</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF20302">Chunk</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF28798">Streamblock</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF30698">Stream time</A></UL><A NAME="XREF29424"><H3>Stream file</A></H3>A file that contains interleaved data the DataStreamer library can parse and display. <P>You create a stream file using the Weaver tool and a Weaver script. <P><A NAME="XREF20302"><H3>Chunk</A></H3>An atomic packet of data of one type; the basic element of a stream. <P>Chunks are timestamped, some with duration. Chunks must be quad-byte aligned, Types include: <P><UL><LI>FILM<LI>SCEL<LI>SAMN<LI>JOIN<LI>CTRL<LI>FILL<LI>SNDS</UL><A NAME="XREF28798"><H3>Streamblock</A></H3>Streamblocks consist of interleaved chunks. Disc reads are done streamblock by streamblock. <P>Streamblocks must be quad-byte aligned. Streamblock size must be a multiple of media size, only one size per stream is possible. Size of streamblocks must match the buffers established by the library. <P><A NAME="XREF30698"><H3>Stream time</A></H3>Every chunk has a stream time, the time at which the chunk needs to be presented. Time is counted in audio folio ticks. <P>If you include the <CODE>writemarkertable</CODE> command in the script, the Weaver tool translates time into file offsets.<P><P>
