Here are some things the Protosubscriber example code includes: <P><UL><LI>Routine to process arriving data chunks <p><LI>Routine to set the status bits of a given channel<p><LI>Routine to return the status bits of a given channel<p><LI>Routine to perform an arbitrary subscriber defined action<p><LI>Routine to close down an open subscription<p><LI>Routine to start all channels for this subscription <p><LI>Routine to stop all channels for this subscription<p><LI>Routine to flush all data waiting and/or queued under the assumption that we have just arrived at a branch point and should be ready to deal with all new data from an entirely different part of the stream<p><LI>Routine to take action on end of file condition<p><LI>Routine to kill all output, return all queued buffers, and generally stop everything. Should return all channels to pre-initialized state.</UL>
