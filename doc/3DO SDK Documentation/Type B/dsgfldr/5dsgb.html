<TITLE>Using appropriate streamblock size and number of buffers</TITLE><H1>Using appropriate streamblock size and number of buffers</H1><HR>This section discusses how using the right streamblock size and number of buffers can improve performance of your application. In reading this section, keep in mind that streamblock size and buffer size <I>must</I> be equal: You specify streamblock size in the Weaver script file when weaving the stream, but you then have to allocate buffers of the same size when playing back the application. If you need to change buffer size, you have to change streamblock size and re-weave your stream. <P>This section discusses:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF36720">Streamblock size restrictions</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF18129">Dealing with data rate spikes</A><LI><A HREF="#XREF27693">Using more buffers to prevent starving buffers</A></UL><A NAME="XREF36720"><H2>Streamblock size restrictions</A></H2>You specify streamblock size in the Weaver script, using the <CODE>streamblocksize</CODE> command. When specifying streamblock size, follow these general rules: <P><UL><LI>Streamblock sizes must be an even multiple of the physical block size of the device. This guarantees that the file system behaves as efficiently as possible. In the case of CD-ROM, the physical block size is 2048 bytes. <p><LI>Using a streamblock size that is a factor or multiple of 32 KB tends to improve performance of the stream because of the caching mechanism in the current CD-ROM firmware. <p><LI>Large streamblocks usually result in a smaller percent of filler but may introduce delays in applications that branch frequently. </UL><A NAME="XREF18129"><H2>Dealing with data rate spikes</A></H2>The maximum data rate from the CD-ROM is 300 KB/s. Because you have to take into account user input and other nonstreaming activities, the observed rate for all data has to be even lower. In practice, <I>brief </I>periods of data consumption in excess of 300 KB/s are possible as long as the average data consumption rate is 300 KB/s or less. The figure below shows how the actual rate from CD (dotted line) fluctuates around the maximum rate (300 KB/s). While the actual rate is higher than the maximum at times, it is usually lower and the stream would probably play with no data rate errors. <P><IMG SRC="Figures/Spikes.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed"><P><B>Figure 3: </B><I>Data rate spikes.</I><P><A NAME="XREF27693"><H2>Using more buffers to prevent starving buffers</A></H2>The main activity of a program that uses streaming is to fill empty buffers with data, hand the data off to subscribers, and empty the buffers after the data have been played (see <A HREF="./3dsga.html#XREF32484">DataStreamer threads and data flow</A>). If data are not placed in a way that prevents bunching up in the buffers, the program may suddenly find no empty buffers in which to place the data, or no data in the buffers it wants to use for playback. Having more buffers makes it easier to process the data as they arrive.<P>The DataStreamer cannot reuse a stream buffer until it receives a reply for every chunk of data it has sent to subscribers. In the table below, the SCEL chunk at time 1000 has a duration of 1200 (five seconds). As a result, the stream buffer that contains the SCEL chunk is unavailable for reuse until the SCEL subscriber has replied that chunk has been played. Five seconds pass before the streamer can refill the buffer. <P><PRE><B>Table 8: </B><I> Chunks in one stream buffer which have different duration.</I>---------------------------------------------------------Type            |Time              |Duration             ---------------------------------------------------------SNDS            |1000              |80                   ---------------------------------------------------------SCEL            |1000              |1200                 ---------------------------------------------------------SNDS            |1163              |80                   ---------------------------------------------------------SNDS            |1243              |80                   ---------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P>To avoid the problem of starving buffers, consider working with the SCEL subscriber or Text subscriber. They allow for a stream header flag that copies a specified chunk out of the stream buffer. You can also use them as sample programs for your own customized subscriber.
