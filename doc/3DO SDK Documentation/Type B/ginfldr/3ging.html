While the 3DO custom plug-ins were written under version 2.5, they can be used under version 2.0, version 2.5, and version 3.0. <P>If you plan to convert a large batch of images to 3DO format, consider using DeBabelizer, which is compatible with Photoshop Plug-Ins, including the plug-ins for reading and writing 3DO cels and images.<P><B>Note: </B>You need DeBabelizer 1.5 to read files saved from Photoshop 2.5, and you must move the CelTypes file to use the CelWriter. <P><A NAME="XREF22321"><H2>Photoshop problems</A></H2>Q:  I took a 640-x-480, 24-bit image, sized it to 320 x 240, reduced it to 256 colors, and then tried to save it as an 8-bit uncoded cel using the CelWriter Custom Plug-In. Photoshop crashes every time.<P>A:  Maybe you have a memory problem. Try turning off all extensions and third-party control panels, or increase the memory allocated using the Get Info command in the Finder. <P><A NAME="XREF14437"><H2>Photoshop and coded cels</A></H2>Q:  I get a strange palette when I use the CelWriter to create coded cels for the 3DO Station. <P>A:  In most cases, it's best to create coded cels from 3DO Animator, where you have full control over the palette. You can also use the Coded-8 CelWriter, which lets you import a palette previously created in 3DO Animator. The 3DO PostPro tool, new in this release, will eventually offer full control over palettes as well. <P><A NAME="XREF27543"><H2>Corrupt CelWriter files from DeBabelizer</A></H2>Q:  When I use the 3DO CelWriter in batch mode with DeBabelizer, I can't open the exported cels with the CelReader or 3DO Animator. <P>A:  Make sure that you've copied the CelTypes file into the DeBabelizer folder before you process your files. Using the 3DO CCMs for DeBabelizer should also yield better results than plug-ins. <P><P>
