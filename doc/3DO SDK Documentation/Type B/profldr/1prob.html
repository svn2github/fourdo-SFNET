<TITLE>Feature overview</TITLE><H1>Feature overview</H1><HR>The features discussed in this section are available, where appropriate, through the entire 3DO PostPro tool. For instance, most actions you can accomplish using menus, dialogs, and windows can also be accomplished with an AppleScript (tm) command. Similarly, any action that you perform can be recorded by AppleScript and used later to drive 3DO PostPro.<P><H2>AppleScript and 3DO PostPro</H2>3DO PostPro makes extensive use of AppleScript. Users with an understanding of AppleScript can automate all of the PostPro functions. Even novice users can record their actions as they go along, and use the generated scripts to quickly automate processes.<P><H2>Drag and drop</H2>3DO PostPro makes use of Apple's Drag &amp; Drop technology, in System 7 and System 7.5. Many basic actions, such as cut and paste, can be accomplished by simple drag and drop. You can also exchange data from other programs with 3DO PostPro using drag and drop gestures. These concepts are described more thoroughly in the System 7 Pro or System 7.5 documentation.<P><H2>QuickTime and 3DO PostPro</H2>3DO PostPro supports QuickTime, Apple's Multimedia standard. This capability allows data interchange with a variety of existing third-party QuickTime-related programs.  <P><H2>Modular design</H2>3DO PostPro is extensible, so new modules that provide additional functionality can be added easily. A module can allow you to open and edit a new file type, convert a document to another type, or support a new hardware platform for data-previewing. <P><H2>Supported file types</H2>PostPro supports the following file types:<P><UL><LI>3DO cel<LI>3DO image <LI>Animation files (ANIM and SANM)<LI>3DStudio files<LI>SDF files<LI>QuickTime movies<LI>AIFF files</UL>
