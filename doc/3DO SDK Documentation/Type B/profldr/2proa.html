<TITLE>About the Workbench</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF28204">About the Workbench</LINK></H1><HR>A Workbench is the functional interface to a piece of hardware, such as a 3DO Development Station. Through the Workbench, you can use 3DO files-cels, images, sounds-in a 3DO environment, and receive valid feedback regarding the content or settings of those files. For example, if you create a cel with various attributes and effects, you can preview it on the Workbench and make corrections as needed. You can watch the changes on the Workbench as you make them.<P>Viewing files on a Macintosh monitor is helpful for discerning pixel alignment along the edges of objects. You no longer have to go into Photoshop to accomplish this task.<P>The 3DO PostPro ability to display a file simultaneously on the television monitor at the same time it is displayed on the Workbench shows the palette differential for NTSC display. You can interactively edit the characteristics (CCB flags and PIXC settings) of displayed art files.
