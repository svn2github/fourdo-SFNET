<TITLE>Starting ARIA</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF25707">Starting ARIA</LINK></H1><HR>Aria currently has a two-step startup, described here:<UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF37656">Setting up the 3DO Debugger</A></UL>The 3DO Debugger takes care of communication between ARIA on your Macintosh and the 3DO Station. You have to set it up correctly before you can start ARIA.<UL><LI><A HREF="#XREF22951">Setting up ARIA</A></UL><B>Note: </B>When you start ARIA for the first time, it creates a number of files and folders on your hard disk. If you expect to use samples to play MIDI, you also have to move some files and folders into those newly created folders, as discussed <A HREF="./2sdtb.html#XREF25707">Setup for working with MIDI</A>. <P><H3>Debugger version requirement</H3>To successfully work with this version of ARIA, you have to use the Debugger from the Toolkit 1.4 CD-ROM or a later version. <P><A NAME="XREF37656"><H2>Setting up the 3DO Debugger</A></H2>It is currently not possible to use ARIA without the 3DO Debugger, since the Debugger is responsible for communicating between the Macintosh and the 3DO Station. <P><OL><LI>Launch the Debugger. <p><LI>Choose one of the default scripts in the <I>3DO:3DO_OS:version:</I> folder, depending on the hardware and monitor you are using. <p><LI>If the words "Not Executing" appear in the menu bar (Debugger 1.9) or in the notification window (Debugger 2.0), release the operating system by typing Command-G. <p><LI>If you wish, close some of the debugging windows to avoid clutter. You should only need the Debugger Terminal window.</OL><A NAME="XREF22951"><H2>Setting up ARIA</A></H2>To set up ARIA, follow these steps:<P><OL><p><LI>With the Debugger running, double-click on the ARIA icon to bring up the application. <p><p><B>Note: </B> If you know you won't need to run MIDI Manager during this round of development, hold down the M key while ARIA is starting up. <BR><p><p>What happens next depends on whether ARIA launched successfully or not: <p><UL><LI>If an error occurs, an alert appears and information about the error is written to the ARIA Log window.
