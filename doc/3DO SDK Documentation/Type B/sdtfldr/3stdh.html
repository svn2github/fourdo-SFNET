<TITLE>Working with PatchDemo scripts</TITLE><H1><LINK NAME="XREF21362">Working with PatchDemo scripts</LINK></H1><HR>PatchDemo is a program that runs on the 3DO development system. It lets you experiment with DSP instruments in a fast and interactive way. Use this program to listen to and prototype complicated DSP instrument configurations for later use in a 3DO title.<P>Using PatchDemo and writing PatchDemo scripts is described in <A HREF="sdt3first.html#XREF36060">Creating Patches with ARIA</A>.<P><H2>How to use PatchDemo scripts with ARIA</H2>ARIA lets you work with PatchDemo in two ways: <P><UL><LI>Write a PatchDemo script, then import it into ARIA and modify the blocks to suit your needs.<p><LI>Create a patch in ARIA, then export it as a PatchDemo script. Load the script into PatchDemo and work with the patch there. </UL>You can work with a PatchDemo script as follows: <P><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------To...                |Do this...                        --------------------------------------------------------Import a PatchDemo   |From the File menu, choose Import script               |PatchDemo Script. ARIA creates and                     |connects the blocks corresponding                      |to the script.                    --------------------------------------------------------Export a PatchDemo   |From the File menu, choose Export script               |PatchDemo Script. ARIA creates a                       |script that corresponds to the                         |block structure of the current                         |patch.                            --------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><H3>Caveats</H3>ARIA supports envelope blocks and PatchDemo does not. You therefore can't export patches containing envelope blocks. <P>PatchDemo supports delay lines and ARIA does not. You therefore can't import PatchDemo scripts referring to delay lines. <P>
