As a result, you will hear pops even when auditioning clean 22 kHz samples from the Sound Designer II Edit window. (It also makes 22 kHz samples sound more boxy than they really are.)<P>All the 22 kHz samples in this collection are pop-free.  To hear them correctly, use the Open dialog box and click on the Play icon.   This bypasses the  software filter.  <P>Also, the Apple Macintosh\xaa  does not produce sound resource files at true 22,050 Hz but instead at 22,100 kHz. Some 3DO developers have noted lip synch problems because the Mac sample plays at 22,100 Hz while the 3DO DSP instruments always play at true 22 kHz (22,050 Hz). <P>To save RAM, 3DO developers might consider using the few "Vk" samples that are provided.  These samples were recorded at SRs appropriate to their pitch (i.e., at the best Nyquist frequency).  Such samples save RAM, but 3DO developers must take a DSP bandwidth hit to use them because  sampler.dsp or the other variable rate DSP instruments take up more code space and ticks. <P><TITLE></TITLE><H1></H1><HR>
