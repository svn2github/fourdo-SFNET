To interact with the patch, follow the instructions on-line, shown in Table 1: <P><PRE><B>Table 1: </B><I> Control pad input for interacting with a patch. </I>--------------------------------------------------------Input                |Result                            --------------------------------------------------------Move cross left/right|Changes X scale of wave display   --------------------------------------------------------Move cross up/down   |Changes Y scale of wave display   --------------------------------------------------------Shift left/right     |Scrolls wave                      --------------------------------------------------------A button             |Refresh                           --------------------------------------------------------C button             |Audio Monitor (see next paragraph)--------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><H3>Audio Monitor</H3>During patch playback, the Audio Monitor displays, in real time, usage of a number of DSP resources. The display shows the usage at the left as a numeric absolute value. A histogram on the right shows the usage as a proportion of the maximum available. If a patch is not working because it exhausts available resources, this histogram helps you find out which resource you have run out of.<P><B>Note: </B>Future versions of 3DO hardware may allocate these resources differently; use them only as a rough guide. <P>Here are some of the resources Audio Monitor displays:<P><PRE>-------------------------------------------------------TKR    |DSP ticks really used at this moment.          -------------------------------------------------------TKA    |DSP ticks allocated.                           -------------------------------------------------------COD    |Code memory allocated.

When you play a patch from the Macintosh keyboard or a MIDI keyboard, the patch is started when you press the key, and released when you release it. The patch is never <I>stopped</I>, so if you have no amplitude envelope to fade out the patch, or if you have an amplitude envelope with a release loop that continues to play after the release point, the note continues to play until you press another key or the space bar.<P>ARIA cuts off unstopped notes about 10 seconds after release.<P><H3>Using the Macintosh keyboard for input</H3>While you're playing the patch, you can use the Macintosh keyboard as a mini-keyboard to play notes. The second row (q, w, e, and so on) has the black notes, the third row (a, s, d, and so on) the white notes on a piano. <P><H3>Using a MIDI keyboard for input</H3>To play a patch from a MIDI keyboard, you must install the Apple MIDI Driver, MIDI manager, and PatchBay, as described in <A HREF="./2sdtb.html#XREF25707">Setup for working with MIDI</A>.<A NAME="XREF29411"></A><P>
