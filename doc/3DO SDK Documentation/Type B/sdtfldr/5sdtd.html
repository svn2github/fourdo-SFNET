<TITLE>Memory considerations</TITLE><H1>Memory considerations</H1><HR>SoundHack uses a large amount of memory, especially when processing sound files of longer duration. If you try processing a sound and get a message that the available memory was not sufficient, do the following:<P><OL><LI>Select the application and choose Get Info from the File menu. <LI>In the Memory box at the bottom right, change the Preferred Size (System 7.1).</OL>Try processing the sound again. If the same message appears, the problem may be a fragmented heap, which means that not enough contiguous memory is available. To remedy this, restart your Macintosh and process the sound again.<P>
