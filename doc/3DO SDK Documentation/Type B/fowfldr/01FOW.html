In addition to applying the usual boldface, shadowed, and outline effects, and so on, FontWriter offers many choices for customization, including the Character Edit window drawing tools.</UL><H1>Audience</H1>This book is for artists and font designers who prepare fonts for a 3DO title.<P><H1>How this document is organized</H1><UL><LI><A HREF="./01FOW001.html#XREF40708">3DO FontWriter Quick Start</A> summarizes the 3DO FontWriter font-building process. <LI><A HREF="./02FOW001.html#XREF41371">3DO FontWriter Reference</A> discusses each menu and window in detail. </UL><H1>Related documentation</H1>Functions to display fonts are now part of the Lib3DO library.
