A flowchart of the process is included.<p><LI><A HREF="./02VID001.html#XREF30012">Selecting Hardware</A> discusses possible hardware combinations and costs.<p><LI><A HREF="./03VID001.html#XREF23639">Capturing and Processing Materials</A> explains how to prepare materials for capture, how to capture them, and how to process them in preparation for compression.<p><LI><A HREF="./04VID001.html#XREF19440">Compressing and Playing Your Movie</A> discusses compression, decompression, and related issues.<p><LI><A HREF="./05VID001.html#XREF37240">Video Tools</A> covers the video processing tools provided or supported by 3DO. These include: <p><UL><LI>The 3-2 Pulldown tool for processing video that was originally based on film. <p><LI>MovieCompress for compressing movies using Apple QuickTime codecs. MovieCompress lets you specify frame rate, key frame rate, data rate, <p><LI>Quality, depth, and codec. It also offers a drag-and-drop feature for opening a movie file, and is AppleScript-scriptable for the four standard events (Open, OpenDoc, Quit, Save).<p><LI>ConvertToMovie, a third-party tool with functionality similar to that of MovieCompress.<p><LI>MovieEdit, which lets you play and edit QuickTime movies. Dynamic displays of time code, time unit, and frame number information give users greater flexibility and precision in editing movies. <p><LI>MovieProcess and MovieProcess PPC (both in the Pioneers folder of this release), which deinterlaces to 20 frames per second (fps), offers variable save options for archiving during different stages of processing, and is scriptable with AppleScript for the four standard events (Open, OpenDoc, Quit, Save).</UL><BR></UL><UL><LI><A HREF="./06VID001.html#XREF33417">EZ Squeeze</A> describes a new 3DO video compression codec found in the <I>Pioneers</I> folder of Toolkit 1.5.</UL><H1>Typographical conventions</H1>The following typographical conventions are used in this document:<P><PRE>-------------------------------------------------------Item                |Example                           -------------------------------------------------------code example        |int32 OpenGraphicsFolio( void )   -------------------------------------------------------procedure name      |CreateScreenGroup                 -------------------------------------------------------new term or emphasis|That added weight is called a                         |cornerweight.                     -------------------------------------------------------file or folder name |Open the red cd file in the                           |cdrommaster folder.               -------------------------------------------------------</PRE><P><P>
