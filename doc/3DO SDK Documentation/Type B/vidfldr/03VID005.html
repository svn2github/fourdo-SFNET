Note that you can create interesting effects using less than full-screen video, incorporated in your title at a smaller size. For example, splitting the screen into different panels and showing video in only one of them can result in considerable space savings. <P><H2>Cropping</H2><B>Full frame</B> -Frame buffer: 640 x 480 <P><UL><LI>Full-frame NTSC visible screen: 576 x 432</UL><B>Letter box</B>-Frame buffer: 640 x 336 <P><UL><LI>NTSC visible screen: 576 x 336</UL><H2>Resizing</H2>You can resize in Photoshop, DeBabelizer, or CoSA After Effects.
